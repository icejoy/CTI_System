When you are a serious IT company, life is freaking hard, especially on April 1. You are expected to follow the tradition — take some lame idea, cover it as real news, and publish it with a straight face. It’s stupid and unnatural.

That’s why a year ago we did quite the opposite: We took a dead-serious issue and disguised it as a goofy April Fool’s post. We drew public attention to the necessity of brain shielding. And it worked!

The data obtained from this experiment will help us protect up to 70% of Earth’s surface by the end of millennium. In the foreseeable future, the entire solar system will be protected by a thin, shiny layer of foil, like so many frozen leftovers.

As for now, we mark the noble tradition and celebrate the 121st birthday of the tinfoil hat by protecting, if not your brain, then at least your Facebook avatar. You can use this tool, revised and updated to repel the latest mind-control technology.

Here are some useful facts for anyone who cares about the security of their brain:

King Midas had the foil touch (widely misreported as the golden touch), but even putting tinfoil on everything did not save the Minoan civilization.
A foil tent could save your life as well as your mind.
