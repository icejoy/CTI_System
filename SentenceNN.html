What is the Security Analyst Summit
A long time ago, in the prehistoric digital era, in a world of big trees while we were a mere bonsai, we started throwing a yearly conference for a select few of the most forward-thinking experts in information security.
We christened the conference the Security Analyst Summit (SAS for short), and right from the get-go we wanted to make it the best event of its kind in the world.
And when I say best, I mean both in terms of content:

Security Analyst Summit 2016: one of the talks
…And in terms of a relaxed and fun atmosphere:

Security Analyst Summit 2016
And to make the best even more memorable for all who take part in it, we traditionally throw SAS at a location with among the most unbearable conditions in the world.
That is, always next to beach in a tropical clime :) Example:

Security Analyst Summit 2015 took place in Cancun, Mexico
…Or:

Security Analyst Summit 2016 took place in Tenerife, Spain
And here we are again on the eve of another SAS.
This year’s will be on the island of St. Maarten in the Caribbean (April 2-6), so there’ll be no shortage of beachiness and oceanity.
And of course there’ll be no shortage of the world’s top cybersecurity experts who’ll be telling all sorts of scary stories about who’s been hacked, where, and how, and what needs to be done in response.
So get involved; it’s gonna be thrilling, I promise (it always is :).
Since the first ever SAS, cyberthreats and the digital landscape on the whole have been transformed so as to be unrecognizable.
Back then there were no smartphones, for example.
And digital attacks on industrial systems were of interest to no one beside geeks, paranoids, fantasists and futurists – also the dogs of cyberwar, for whom a whole new cyber-landscape for military operations was opening up.
And there was no Stuxnet either!
Back then IT security had a very narrow focus.
Accordingly, the conference started out as an internal get-together for our own experts from around the globe.
Only later did it become an industry-wide get-together, in keeping with the times: as the threat of cyberattacks became one of the main topics on agendas at corporate, national and international levels, while financial services, Internet trading and the Internet of Things were entering practically every home.
As it went more and more industry-wide, SAS also became more interesting to a broader range of cybersecurity folks – from all sorts of different types of companies.
Larger and larger sponsors got involved, and the list of accredited media in attendance grew, with larger and more influential global media outlets reporting next to their specialized trade press siblings.
Security Analyst Summit 2017: sponsors
So what can we expect at this year’s SAS?
Detailed presentations on investigations into the world’s most complex and advanced cyberattacks.
Discussion of trends.
Where’s the world heading; what will be the cyberthreats of the future, and how will we survive them.
A practical part: training sessions from our experts.
These allow large companies to create and develop their own teams of cyberthreat hunters.
Investigations into the problems of industrial security.
This is a new but already veeerrry hot topic, with SAS being one of the very few forums in the world set up for seriously deep discussion of issues of industrial control systems’ security, the Internet of Things, driverless vehicles and other such hotness.
In fact, it’s the one of the most widely believed myths in the infosec world.
At the same time, it’s the most non-standard one.
That double-sided nature is likely the reason why the myth is so enduring.
Fact or Fiction: can a virus actually damage PC hardware?
At the dawn of the PC era, the late 20th century, users frequently spread scary stories that happened “to one of good friends of theirs,” from a virus.
In such stories, viruses, for instance, fed some ‘wrong’ interlacing to a CRT monitor and ‘burned out’ the PC’s hardware components.
In other tales, malware made HDD plates ‘resonate’ fiercely, ultimately destroying hard drives.
Or overclocked a floppy drive to cause an imminently deadly rotor overheat.
Sure some of these cases are theoretically plausible, but built-in foolproof protection mechanisms don’t allow such failures to happen.
So, as they say, sleep tight, little friends, they shall not pass, and all that kind of stuff.
Fact or Fiction: can a #virus actually damage PC hardware?
Anything can happen, after all, with vendors hushing up things.
Yet, life is a curious thing and full of surprises.
For example, back in 1999 a massive Win95.CIH (a.k.a. Chernobyl) virus pandemic took over thousands of machines.
That malware corrupted data stored both on a hard drive and on BIOS chips on motherboards.
Some of the affected PCs would not start as their boot program was damaged.
To level the adverse effects of the attack, one had to replace BIOS chips and rewrite the data.
Was that effectively a physical damage inflicted on a PC?
In reality, no.
After a series of manipulations motherboards could be cured and returned to the operating state.
But the problem could not be solved by standard ‘home emergency kit’ and required specialized equipment.
Today, everything is even more confusing.
First, any standalone piece of hardware is bundled with a rewritable microprogram, at times with even more than one.
I’m surprised this trend did not affect screws which hold this too smart hardware together.

Each of those microprograms has been evolving for years, having become quite a complex piece of software, which is by design potentially open to an attack.
Once the attack is successful, the consequences are not always immediately remediable.
Take the story about modified firmware of hard drives.
For the record, while analyzing the Equation cyberespionage campaign, Kaspersky Lab experts explored spyware modules injected into microprogram code for a number of different HDD models.
These pieces of malware are used to gain complete control over the affected disk; which cannot be remedied even by formatting.

One cannot change the firmware by means of a standard toolset — the firmware is responsible for updating itself.
As you would expect, it puts a hell of a fight when someone tries to lure it from where it belongs.
Of course, if you happen to be in possession of specialized equipment, you might be able to apply force and change any microprogram.
In real life, an affected drive goes straight to the trash – it’s the most cost-effective option.
Can it be considered physical damage?
But the number of stories about hardware-based vulnerabilities continues to increase.

Second, it’s quite unclear what kind of machine can be defined as ‘computer.’
For instance, any current car is, to some extent, a computer — and what’ even more important – a connected computer on wheels.
It is exposed to remote hacks and compromise, as we found out in a recent well-publicized demonstration of the remote hack of a Jeep Cherokee.

Right, the hack was performed by hackers, not a virus — Ok, it was a piece of cake, given years of research this hack took.
However, it won’t come as a surprise if an attack like that will end up with a car hitting some pole on the roadside.
I guess this can be called damage.
So, can a virus actually damage PC hardware?
Is it fact or fiction?
That’s truth.
However, the answer here heavily depends on what you actually mean by “damage”, “virus”, “PC”, etc.
We’ve written about insecure fingerprint sensors and other biometric technologies a lot.
We were not alone, of course.
It looks like the fuss did some good.
Biometric technologies at MWC 2017
Fingerprint sensor evolution

IDEX, a Norwegian company that ships fingerprint sensors for LG and other companies, claims that the majority of its partner smartphone developers enable access to fingerprint sensors’ data only within a secure environment.
I talked to several fingerprint sensor makers at MWC, and all of them use a fully protected scheme for handling such data.
In the beginning, “raw” data from a fingerprint sensor is encrypted, then the system detects distinctive ridges, encrypts them as well, and sends to secure storage.
All of these operations take place in a trusted execution environment — an isolated space that cannot be accessed by any outer process.
Yet, several sensor makers still let gadget companies decide if they want to use the protection mechanism.
Regardless, data is always securely encrypted on the way from sensor to processor, and that’s good: Previously, the main vulnerability of fingerprint reading technologies was right here.
A sensor maker called CrucialTec decided to make biometrics even more … well, biometric, adding heart-rate sensors to fingerprint scanners.
It’s a protective measure: 3D-printed finger copies, plaster fingers, and even real fingers cut off of their owners will not work.
The same holds true for simple copies of finger ridges created with a common printer.
MWC 2017: bank card with fingerprint sensor
This system checks ridges to confirm that they are similar but doesn’t unlock the smartphone until it detects a proper heartbeat.
This is a serious step ahead in fingerprint authentication security.
Resourceful criminals will no doubt find a way to trick this protection as well — for example, with a copy of a finger’s ridges pressed to the scanner using the real, live finger of a different person — but it will be much harder.
One Chinese company presented an unusual implementation: a fingerprint scanner built directly into the glass of a smartphone display.
There were a few limitations: first, the only sample remained in China, and so the company could not show it.
In addition they are not completely sure how users will understand which part of the display they should tap to get in — the sensor is not clearly visible!
Last year IDEX presented a similar idea, but it seems that it didn’t go further than a concept.
By the way, developers say fingerprint sensors are not limited to gadgets; they can be built into door locks or car keys.
Several companies offer flexible and very thin sensors that can be used as a part of banking card.
MWC 2017: door lock with fingerprint sensor
The technology is implemented in various ways: For example, IDEX offers a scheme that does not require an additional supply of electricity, whereas CrucialTec builds a battery and a simple display into the card to show if the user is successfully authorized or not.
The fingerprint sensor can be a good alternative to PIN codes: easier to use and harder to fake — it’s very easy to spy a PIN when a person enters it.
A little more biometry

Two years ago, Qualcomm presented SenseID — more secure and quick ultrasonic fingerprints scanners.
This time, the company offered another authentication method that scans your iris.
Every person has unique irises, so this authentication method is quite reliable.
Qualcomm’s system is new, so it’s built only into prototypes for now, but it works surprisingly well: quickly and without mistakes.
In case you’re wondering why this technology is so late in coming to the smartphone market, the reason is simple: Earlier cameras were too slow, and imaging processors were less powerful.
By the way, Qualcomm’s iris recognition system can distinguish a fake copy of an iris from a real eye.
There was a surprisingly realistic 3D-printed face at the Qualcomm booth, and the software did not mistake it for a real one.
As far as I understand, the system takes into account that eyes move a little all the time.
MWC 2017: fake face in Qualcomm booth
It’s noteworthy that the system can recognize irises even through big, black sunglasses.
Unfortunately, Qualcomm refuses to explain how it achieved this result.
All in all, iris recognition is much more secure than, for example, face recognition.
However, it suffers from the same problem as the rest of biometric technologies do: Once criminals find a way to steal and use biometric data (and they will surely try, if biometric ATMs become widespread), users will be stuck, not being able to change their faces, irises, or fingerprints.
Several other interesting concepts from MWC 2017

We saw quite a lot of interesting innovations related to information security in Barcelona this year.
For example, Qualcomm presented on-device machine-learning technology.
Qualcomm showed first steps in this direction last year, when it presented a solution that tried to recognize objects in pictures.
Now this technology has developed into a universal engine that is compatible with many popular frameworks and given to developers.
This is a step ahead: On-device machine learning can free users from having to send data to the cloud.
And that brings privacy concepts to fields where privacy had become unimaginable, because usually machine learning requires cloud technologies — i.e., giving up our data.
It’s currently just an engine, not a consumer-ready solution.
Well, one technology already uses it — a technology developed by (you guessed it) Qualcomm.
It’s called App Protect, and it enables implementation of heuristic algorithms for the detection of malicious applications at the hardware–software level.
Qualcomm considers an app malicious if it tries to do anything secretly — gathers users’ location and contacts information, sends or intercepts SMSs, that sort of thing.
App Protect helps to detect such apps and prohibit access to sensitive data.
The technology is not a ready-to-use solution; it must be integrated into a security app.
All in all, our Kaspersky Antivirus and Security for Android does it efficiently at the software level.
MWC 2017 more focused on security than in previous years.
Today, you see the word “secure” at almost every booth.
Even if things aren’t really secure, the optics show that developers are starting to care more about protection.
As for biometric authentication alone, this technology may overcome the many downsides it has now.
It will never become fully secure — there’s no such thing.
But the steps we see are moving in the right direction, which gladdens us a lot.
It’s true not much malware exists in the wild for MacOS or iOS.
But there is some — and phishing sites, spammers, and carders don’t discriminate on the basis of operating system.
In addition to providing the usual navigation tools, it blocks malicious and phishing websites.
How to explore the Internet safely on your iPad and iPhone
First things first: Kaspersky Safe Browser is a free app you can download from the AppStore.
The Safe Browser interface is similar to Safari’s, so you will pick it up easily.
The browser supports most popular search engines including Google, Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo.
How Kaspersky Safe Browser protects you from online threats

The browser blocks phishing sites as well as fraudulent or spammy links by default.
That way, your private and financial data is always secured — you don’t need to set up anything, it works right out of the box.
Kaspersky Safe Browser for iOS interface and design
What’s more important, the browser protects you from even the latest threats, because it receives real-time updates from our security cloud.
That means each time we detect a malicious website, our cloud notifies Kaspersky Safe Browser, and the app adds the dangerous URLs to its blocking database.
It’s unlikely you’ll need to consult our Knowledge Base about Kaspersky Safe Browser — the app is very intuitive — but we’ll add these links just in case: Here is how to install Kaspersky Safe Browser and how to configure its settings.
When you are a serious IT company, life is freaking hard, especially on April 1.
You are expected to follow the tradition — take some lame idea, cover it as real news, and publish it with a straight face.
That’s why a year ago we did quite the opposite: We took a dead-serious issue and disguised it as a goofy April Fool’s post.
We drew public attention to the necessity of brain shielding.
International Tinfoil Hat Day 2017 
Thanks to the newly instituted holiday, Tinfoil Hat Day, people all over the world learned about the invisible foes all around us, and began shielding themselves from mind-control with help of protective hats.
We were the first to answer the call and wrapped our logo in foil.
Here’s how it looked before:

Meanwhile, our comrades carried out a similar important project in the Antarctic Circle related to the very same problem.
Having disguised their academic expedition as the Antarctic Biennale cultural event, and while distracting potential foes with art installations and performances, our fellow researchers tinfoiled some 20 square meters of the territory.
In this picture, you can see how the native population welcomed the relief from their constant battle against mind-control.

The data obtained from this experiment will help us protect up to 70% of Earth’s surface by the end of millennium.
In the foreseeable future, the entire solar system will be protected by a thin, shiny layer of foil, like so many frozen leftovers.
As for now, we mark the noble tradition and celebrate the 121st birthday of the tinfoil hat by protecting, if not your brain, then at least your Facebook avatar.
You can use this tool, revised and updated to repel the latest mind-control technology.
Here are some useful facts for anyone who cares about the security of their brain:

In hot weather, a tinfoil hat may be both the reason for and the consequence of overheating.
Dried fruit doesn’t walk.
If dried fruit approaches you, see 1 for explanation.
A tinfoil hat is not sufficient to protect one from the destructive commanding force of a TV screen; we recommend wrapping the television as well.
Ancient Greeks continuously used the principles of protection from detrimental emissions: Perseus successfully protected himself from the Gorgon using Athena’s copper shield.
King Midas had the foil touch (widely misreported as the golden touch), but even putting tinfoil on everything did not save the Minoan civilization.
A foil tent could save your life as well as your mind.
At this time of year, the number of tax scams reaches a peak, with fraudsters looking for any chance to cash in on consumers, the self-employed, and small businesses that might get excited enough about potential refunds to throw caution and good sense out the window.
Many people now do their taxes online, and cybercriminals see that as a huge opportunity to make money with phishing schemes.
The IRS saw a 400% surge in phishing and malware incidents during the 2016 tax season, and that trend is likely to continue this year.
It's tax scam time
Take the recent W-2 e-mail scam, which sent victims requests for information about an employee W-2 form from a company’s payroll or human resources departments.
At this time of year, a harried staffer might not think twice.
With cybercriminals always looking for monetary gain, it’s important for consumers and businesses alike to be aware of what to look out for.
This includes:

Phishing e-mails — These messages attempt to entice you into providing sensitive information by pretending to be a legitimate organization (e.g., the IRS).
Phone calls — Smooth criminals try to trick people into giving out information over the phone.
The information can then be used either to access an account directly or to send credible-looking phishing e-mails.
Apps — A fraudulent app can access information without a user realizing anything has happened.
We recommend the following top tips to stay safe when managing your tax affairs this year:

1.
Give yourself plenty of time to file your tax return to lessen the risk that you will respond in haste to a scam;

2.
Don’t trust advice about how to get a refund unless it comes from a tax professional or source that you trust — if in doubt, always double-check;

3.
Don’t assume a bank or government agency has access to your tax details.
They will not have granular information about your tax return.
Even if a communication looks legitimate, check over the details first and if in doubt, contact the apparent source of the information using publicly available contact information (not details from the communication you’re trying to verify);

4.
If using a mobile app to file your tax return, do so over a secure connection and make sure you have mobile Internet security — and that it’s up to date.
Also make sure you review permissions requested by any app before accepting them;

5.
Do not click on attachments or links in messages that look suspicious or that you received from unknown people;

Do not enter your credit card details on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, to lessen the risk of passing them on to cybercriminals.
Fake sites can be made to look just like the legitimate site that they’re trying to spoof.
It’s always best to type in a URL yourself, and always check that there’s a secure connection between you and the site — look for “https” at the start of the address bar;

7.
Install a security solution on your device, with built-in technologies designed to prevent financial fraud.
For example, the Safe Money feature in Kaspersky Lab solutions creates a secure environment for financial transactions.
The IRS gets enough of your hard-earned cash.
Don’t let the rest of it go to cybercriminals.
About a year ago, a number of people, truly passionate enthusiasts and straight-up frauds alike, started manically preaching the coming of the Blockchain Almighty.
It will change the world forever, said the Cult of the Blockchain.
The technology, they predicted, would enable ultimate transaction chain transparency thanks to the distributed ledger.
Traditional payments systems would be tossed out on the garbage heap of history.
Central banks would be transformed throughout the world.
Keeping blockchain on track while the hype fades
And forget about transactions for a sec — blockchain was set to make a lot of other things obsolete.
For example, the fanatics said, thanks to blockchain, we’ll no longer need to notarize documents, and GPS data could confirm deliveries, causing payments to be released automatically when an item arrives at its destination.
Basically, to fix the world’s imperfections, just add blockchain.
Unfortunately, neither enthusiasts nor frauds managed to explain how the magic would happen.
Worse, no one bothered to talk about blockchain’s drawbacks, except for the problem of its high performance demands, which make the technology unviable for massive transactions (say, tens of thousands of transactions per second, as is common in any modern payment system).
By end of 2016, the lively conversation had died away.
Now it’s time to give this technology a sober look and figure out what blockchain is and why it can indeed introduce some fundamental changes.
What is blockchain?
Simply put, blockchain is a chain of transactions.
Each block on the chain — or database — contains information about the previous block.
One cannot change the information without attracting notice.
Once transaction data is affirmed by miners (the controllers or keepers of the process), the block becomes iron-clad.
Its contents are open, but they are protected by a hash chain.
The database contains publicly available, unencrypted information about all transactions, signed by asymmetric key.
I don’t think it makes sense to cover the topic is deeper detail, since you can read it in a separate post.
But in essence, using blockchain we (theoretically) can obtain a reliable, initially trusted, and tamperproof database.
It’s impossible to mimic a transaction by showing a faux payment confirmation.
You cannot say you paid on time but the transaction took a long time to execute.
They say you can negotiate even with a bank, but not with blockchain.
All of your actions are carved in stone, with no government involvement needed.

Simplifying blockchain - https://kas.pr/SsH6  #bitcoin #infosec101 #banking

So, what’s the problem?
There are a lot of miners who are ready to hash blocks.
Everyone needs transparency and reliability.
And no one really likes regulators and other monopolists.
Why is blockchain nowhere to be found?
Not so fast

Blockchain experts say the distributed ledger cuts transaction time from days to minutes.
But there is more to the story: they’re talking about complex transactions involving higher numbers of objects and subjects.
As an example, if one were to use a blockchain-secured transaction to buy an island with a construction site, the verification and all background checks would take much less time than they would using traditional methods.
Whereas traditionally, dozens of people would need to dig into piles of documents and papers to affirm the status of the land, construction, and encumbrances, and at the same time verify the authenticity of documents, a blockchain complete these tasks in an instant.
The object of purchase is checked, the money is paid, and the next block inherits the name of the new owner.
(However, we’re setting aside the work of getting the information about the island into the blockchain: if you seriously want to use blockchain for real estate transactions you need to gather all the ownership history you can about as many properties as you can, and put it in blockchain database; otherwise it’s unlikely to work).
But for simple transactions like a person-to-person money transfer, the speed of translation does not increase — quite the opposite.
Blockchain was developed to support Bitcoin, which assumes a block takes 10 minutes to create, regardless of the equipment’s processing power.
Also, the system runs corrections after every 2,016 blocks, which adds more time.
In traditional, centralized systems such a transaction takes a fraction of a second.
Another pain point is the considerable (and constantly growing) volume of data associated with each transaction.
When megabytes of data are transferred to and fro every time a transaction of a few dollars is executed, any computing system will break.
Finally, omnipresent, crystal-clear transparency is simply not needed.
Blockchain is a high-precision, specialized tool for vast yet limited scope of use cases — not a panacea for regulators and existing payment systems.
So, nothing new?
Distributed databases are a thing of the late 80s.
Once more powerful computers were united into local and then global networks, there emerged an immediate need to enable a precise block of data to be transferred without involving the central node.
This approach was specifically interesting to the defense officials who wanted to pass a packet from A to B, being 100% sure of its integrity and the success of the transfer, regardless of any pesky troubles — like, say, a nuclear blast.
Blockchain is just one of the improved and enhanced varieties of distributed database that can be used for financial transactions both reliably and confidentially.
Some actually think that Bitcoin was created by military folks who sought ways to sponsor new rebels in the Middle East without anyone finding out.
That’s one reason regulators are a bit unsettled.
It’s great when new and exciting technology emerges, but it would be quite upsetting to find out, after years of use, that the shadowy figure who created it installed a backdoor.
A regulator we need / don’t need

In the ideal “Blockchain World” model, government plays little or no role in any transactions.
People and organizations have to agree between themselves that blockchain is reliable and should be used in transactions.
But the real world has other rules — someone big and powerful has to pull the strings.
For example, if one person promises to pay another in Bitcoins for purchased goods, and then reneges, then the wronged party needs to be able to go to court and plead for restitution or punishment.
Today, such transactions exist in a legal gray area.
For blockchain transactions to work in the real world, there needs to be a system for handling mishaps — or mischief — which means making regulations that courts can use to enforce the rules.

Here is another scenario.
One advanced bank decides to execute a blockchain transaction — and does so.
Let’s imagine the reaction of a central bank.
If the transaction was large enough, it’s entirely likely that the bank would lose its license the very same day.
That means, for such a transaction to be legitimate, the government needs to pass some acts.
Of course, blockchain might spare central banks having to manage the control and validation of transactions.
But regulation and enforcement are still necessary; the adoption of blockchain won’t make the world a perfect place.
Why the silence?
Lately, the hype around blockchain has quieted.
Some banks even decided to leave the R3 blockchain consortium after joining with great fanfare in autumn 2016.
Does that mean the hype is done?
Is blockchain, like Pokémon Go and “neural network” photo filter apps, dead to the media?
Actually, quite the contrary.
Those who have quieted down were the loudest supporters of the technology — the true believers and the frauds.
Meanwhile, some major companies such as IBM have developed dozens of prototypes and are starting to work on beta versions.
Those solutions are intended for the applications we described above — freight, certification of deals, real estate, business correspondence, document exchange, and more.
In this case, it’s quite clear which problems these solutions are designed for and whether they have profit potential.
They do not need to brag: The work is being done, and this looks like just the calm before the storm.
Bank of Canada and its partners created project Jasper to test blockchain.
Of course, not a lot of details are available, but some curious findings are known.
It was found the system would not work without a central bank, because standards must be applicable to everything in their sphere, even blockchain.
Which raises a tricky question: How many verifiers (miners) should there be, and who can be entrusted with access to the blocks?
In addition to trials, a couple of attempts have been made to demonstrate blockchain support as a token of a product’s “innovation.”
However, no one has ever succeeded turning a dog into a mermaid by attaching a fish tail to its body.
Blockchain is another key technology suffering from too much PR.
We’ve seen that happen with any number of technologies: cloud, P2P, and big data, to name a few.
First come the overexcited fanatics screaming with delight.
But then — zap!
— a technology becomes ubiquitous, although not usually in the way it was initially advertised.
Blockchain is about to make its way into many enterprises and verticals in the form of so-called private blockchains.
It’ll be some time before the private blockchains start interacting with each other.
A bit.
Main Findings

The rapid growth in the use of applications has significantly added to the digital clutter that exists on people’s digital devices: for example, users typically install 12 Android apps every month but delete only 10, in effect adding two apps to their device on a monthly basis.
As a result, some apps are left unused and idle on digital devices: On computers, at least 30% of installed applications are never used.
The danger is that apps remain active even though the user is not using them: on average users have 66 apps on their Android device, but an experiment which installed a representative sample of 66 of the most popular Android apps, found that 54 of them consumed 22Mb of traffic per day without a user even interacting with them.
Poor user maintenance of device content also generates a build-up of digital clutter: although in 55% of cases people regularly revise the contents of their device and delete unused docs and apps, in 32% of cases people only do this occasionally and in 13% of cases they try not to delete any docs and apps at all.
Improper app hygiene extends to managing apps: the survey found that 65% of users update apps on their smartphones as soon as they are released, but 24% only do so when they are forced to.
Moreover, only 40% intentionally adjust apps settings of each application on smartphone.
This can be a problem because apps have access to user sensitive information: 96 in 100 Android apps start working without users launching them, and 83 in 100 have access to sensitive user data such as accounts, contacts, messages, calls, files stored etc.
Some of the major problems that result from digital data overload are an increase in intrusive and unsolicited ads that often use vulnerabilities to penetrate the device: this was cited by survey respondents as a problem on smartphones (61%), tablets (47%) and for computers (55%).
Other prominent threats highlighted were devices developing glitches (38% on smartphone) or a malware infection (28% on computers).
This digital clutter and careless user behaviour is leaving devices — and the sensitive information they contain — vulnerable to security threats: our survey reveals that over half (56%) of users have lost data on their smartphone, over a third (39%) on tablets and 51% on computers.
Introduction

The digital age has created a mountain of digital clutter, and the explosion in the use of applications means that an increasing amount of information is saved on smartphones, tablets and personal computer devices.
Whereas, once upon a time, users quickly reached the storage capacity of their phone and had to make space available for new data, today capacity is less of an issue so people take five photos instead of one, “just to be sure”.
More space and power equals more data and apps.
Personal and sensitive information, such as address book contacts, text messages, videos and photos, now clutter our digital world, but failure to look after this information is putting it at risk.
As much as in the physical world, users need to take the cleaning of their digital ‘home’ more seriously.
Just like a clean, uncluttered room breathes fresh energy into your home and life, in the same way, an uncluttered computer or smartphone results in a more enjoyable and productive experience.
Digital clutter is a phenomenon that is the result of poor user device maintenance.
Maybe because users no longer have to worry about storage limits, they’ve become lethargic about reviewing and protecting their devices and updating the apps.
This means that, increasingly, our digital junk sits on our devices or in the cloud in perpetuity.
The problem is that the more we accumulate digitally, the more people open up their device to security threats that risk sensitive data, such as passport and credit card information, falling into the wrong hands.
That’s why users should take time to update and delete unused apps for the essential care of their device.
The purpose of this study is to find out the extent to which users are drowning in digital clutter.
We aim to reveal what problems this causes users and offer some useful advice on what can be done to improve the security and safety of sensitive information.
Methodology

This study is based on insight gained from a unique combination of online research and technical analysis of security threats and app performance:

Statistics from the Kaspersky Security Network, a cloud-based system that processes depersonalized cyberthreat-related statistics received from millions of Windows and Android devices owned by Kaspersky Lab users across the globe.
A real-life experiment on Android devices that analyzed the performance of applications was conducted in January 2017 by Kaspersky Lab internal testers.
An online survey conducted by research firm Toluna and Kaspersky Lab in January 2017 assessed the attitudes of 16,250 users aged over 16 years old from 17 countries.

Information overload

These days our devices are used as storage for all aspects of our digital lives.
Users tend to save everything, even things that they know, deep down, they’ll never need or be able to find.
This type of data is a major contributor to unnecessary clutter on our devices.
But unlike clutter in the real world — where stacks of papers, books, clothing and other assorted junk can be physically seen — there are no obvious outward signs that could indicate a problem.
Our global online survey shows that a large majority of people store a wide range of information on their devices.
Overall, the most common items stored on digital devices are general photos and videos for nine in ten (90%) of respondents.
This is closely followed by personal emails (89%) and photos and videos of travel (89%), address book information (84%) and personal text or messages (79%).
Data stored on devices:

My Precious Data: Data stored on devices
We found that in almost two thirds (62%) of cases users have their passwords, including auto-login for websites and apps, stored on their devices.
More than half also store financial and payment information (62%), or scans of their passports, driver’s licenses, insurance certificates and other sensitive documents (57%).
We see differences from country to country.
For example, scans of sensitive documents are particularly popular for users in the UAE (87%) compared to Japan (32%).
Similarly, the storage of private and sensitive photos and videos is less big in Europe (48%), than in Russia (67%).
In the face of this ever-increasing mountain of data, we set about understanding how often users tend to wipe data and apps from their devices.
Overall, the survey found that in only 55% of cases users said they regularly revise the contents of their device and delete everything they haven’t used in a long time, and in a third of cases (32%) users said they do this occasionally, for example, when they don’t have any more space available.
Worryingly, in one-in-ten (13%) cases people said they never delete anything.
Attitudes to app data

A few years ago it would have been hard to predict the rapidly exploding app industry, but there’s no sign of any slowdown in its growth yet.
Apps are available for all areas of digital life, from fitness trackers to productivity tools, and from travel planners to social media.
The apps and the data they accumulate leads to digital clutter that can rob phones of performance, decrease available storage space and put users at risk of security threats.
Different pieces of research conducted by Kaspersky Lab show that the apps and programs used vary according to device.
Generally, and perhaps unsurprisingly, we see that PCs are mostly used for work, tablets for entertainment and smartphones for communication.
Moreover, in our survey we see that the build-up of digital clutter is most acute on the device we carry around with us all day — the smartphone.
Smartphones are the devices that typically have many apps that contain the most sensitive user data, such as contactless payment information or private photos and personal messaging.
Applications installed on user devices:

My Precious Data: Applications installed on user devices
However, we can reveal that large groups of users fail to undertake the basic procedures for keeping this device clutter-free and therefore less vulnerable to security threats.
Research based on data from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) shows that, on average, users have 66 apps installed on their Android device.
However, in the survey users say they only have 15 which perhaps suggests that users aren’t aware of the number of apps, and therefore the volume of data, they carry around with them.
We see that, on average, users typically install 12 apps on their Android devices every month but delete only 10, in effect adding two apps to their device on a monthly basis.
With users adding more apps and more data to their devices every month, attitudes to app cleansing are important in order to combat the problem of digital clutter.
The survey showed that although three quarters of users (77%) have deleted a smartphone app within month period, 12% don’t remember when they last deleted one.
The smartphone is the device that is cleaned most often: for example, 26% of users do not remember when they last deleted an app from their computers.
People probably clean smartphones more often because there is less space available: 35% deleted an app from a smartphone because there was no more space, compared to just 13% on computers.
This point is supported by KSN research that shows computer applications are often redundant on the machine.
We found that people never use at least a third (30%) of applications installed on their computers over a six-month period (excluding drivers, runtime software and other programs users do not work with directly).
Best practice for the general maintenance of applications installed on devices requires people to understand user agreements and adjust the settings for apps.
However, we found that only a third (32%) of respondents read agreements carefully and are able to decline installation of the app on their smartphone if they are not satisfied.
This is important because apps have access to a lot of sensitive information on devices.
Furthermore, the survey found that under half (40%) intentionally adjust the settings of each application on their smartphone.
This is particularly popular in the US (48%), UAE (46%) and Asia-Pacific (44%) rather than in Israel (26%), Japan (33%) and Russia (36%).
App settings enable the user to manage how the app interacts with the device.
For example, apps can get access to user sensitive information, track user locations and share user data with third party servers.
Failure to manage these settings can result in unused apps gaining access to information on the device without the user being aware.
Apps and devices

The issue of app cleansing and maintenance is important because, for the smartphone in particular, they contain the most sensitive data and are constantly with us.
Improperly managed smartphone apps also represent a security threat because they often transmit data even when they’re not being used.
Kaspersky Lab set up an experiment to test how the world’s top Android apps, defined by KSN statistics, behave in a variety of circumstances.
We downloaded 66 apps (the average number of apps installed on one Android device) selected according to popularity.
These top 66 apps in total took up about 5GB of storage.
The devices were formatted, fitted with SIM cards and restarted, connected to the mobile Internet and with Wi-Fi set-up.
None of the third-party applications were launched by testers and we recorded figures for the data usage of each application.
Of the top 66, only 12 applications didn’t have any traffic consumption.
But interestingly, on average, the remaining 54 run without user consent consuming 22Mb of traffic per day without a user even interacting with the apps.
The resulting impact on the device includes issues with performance and battery life.
This is backed up by the technical findings of the KSN research.
Analysis shows that of 100 Android apps that users can manage through installing, deleting or updating, 96 start working without users actually launching them manually.
Furthermore, 83 in 100 have access to user sensitive data, such as contacts, files and messages, and can even make calls and send SMSs.
This is a tempting prospect for cybercriminals looking to exploit sensitive data.
My Precious Data: The secret life of apps
These findings highlight the importance of managing and deleting unused apps, because they are often working in the background, even if the user is not aware of it.
Updating apps

It is important for users to update apps as soon as new versions are released because they might include security patches that prevent or reduce vulnerabilities in the app.
We found that 65% of users update apps on their smartphone as soon as they are released, while a quarter (24%) only do this when they are forced to.
The trend for updating apps as soon as they’re launched was found to be particularly strong in the UAE (78%) and Latin America (68%), when compared to Russia (55%).
In contrast, computer users are less likely to update apps.
48% of users update apps as soon as possible, 30% do this only when they are forced to, and 12% try not to update apps on their PCs at all.
According to KSN stats, no more than half of users install updates for the most exploited software (such as pdf readers, browsers, etc.) on their computers during the week after these updates are released.
The most popular apps on the app stores issue updates that will often include relevant bug fixes as frequently as weekly, while other release cycles may happen every few months.
In fact, Kaspersky Lab’s study into app usage revealed that, on average, the most popular 300 Android apps are updated every 45 days.
However, we also show that 88 apps from this list are never updated, leaving them — and their users — at risk of exploitation by cybercriminals.
This is risky, because apps that are not updated are doors for malware to exploit vulnerabilities in the apps and OS as a means of penetrating the device.
In 2016, four million exploits were detected, which is 16% more than in 2015.
Overall, in the last year Kaspersky Lab’s solutions combated 758,044,650 attacks on Internet users around the world, and many such attacks were using vulnerabilities in software and OS.
My Precious Data: Device downfalls

Problems with data ‘obesity’

The phrase data obesity has been coined in recent years to describe the way users clutter digital devices with excess information.
The analogy implies that you may be continually snacking on new information which may provide very little value in your life — and then creating a number of problems by storing all that nutrition-less information on your devices.
Users exhibit careless behaviour towards the hygiene of their devices despite the fact that we found fears over personal data loss are well founded across all digital devices.
Our survey reveals that 56% of users have lost data on their smartphone, 39% on tablets and 51% on computers.
In most of these cases, data was deleted because of a damaged device or a user accidentally deleted it, and the third most common reason was malware infection.
For example, in the case of smartphones, we found 73% of those in the Asian-Pacific region have lost data in contrast to 44% in Europe.
A wide range of other problems associated with digital data overload are also highlighted in the study.
For example, the main problem with devices cited by respondents was intrusive and unsolicited ads, for smartphones (61%), tablets (47%) and for computers (55%).
These ads often use vulnerabilities to penetrate the device, and in 2016 the most popular and dangerous mobile Trojans were advertising Trojans that can obtain superuser rights on the device.
Users highlighted problems with battery life, lack of memory and unsolicited ads on smartphones more often than on tablets and computers.
This is caused by poor device maintenance and happens when users fail to delete apps and update them, opening the device up to security threats.
At the same time, computers faced glitches and malware more than smartphones and tablets.
Conclusion

This report demonstrates the scale of the problem with the data that permeates across all the devices that help us to manage our digital lives.
Digital clutter is increasing and so are user problems associated with it.
User behaviour and attitudes to applications are the source of many of these issues.
Many users fail to undertake the simple but essential care of their device that cleans and updates software and apps, adjusts settings and uninstalls unused apps.
These actions are important to the hygiene of devices and the data that exists on it — from phone through to tablet and computer.
Just as it’s become traditional to clean out our closets, attics, and garages each spring, it’s good practice to regularly clear out and refresh digital spaces.
It keeps them running smoothly and protects security, so spending a little time to get your digital house in order could prevent you from losing important or sensitive information in the future.
With time, we’ve unknowingly accumulated mountains of unwanted data that could leave us exposed to ever-increasing cybersecurity threats.
The digital world is growing and so is our capacity to store this data.
But the fact that we have the capability to store vast information doesn’t mean we should.
Frank Schwab, Professor in Media Psychology at the University Wuerzburg, says that because users don’t understand the risks associated with digital clutter, they don’t invest the time in good device and app maintenance.
He said: “People tend to be irrational in evaluating risk in everyday life — in both directions.
Rational decisions require a very conscious mental act, and this also applies when dealing with digital devices.
It is exhausting and requires effort, so we need to invest in it and in many cases we are simply too lazy to do so.”
Frank Schwab continued: “Cyberthreats, in addition, are such that most of us cannot understand how they work, they do not produce dramatic images and they are hardly ever the topic of everyday conversation.
For our emotional functioning, which is based on simple rules and experiences, there is no reason to change behavior, as the feeling of threat is extremely low.
This means that investing time in keeping our devices clean is psychologically not relevant to us, as we don’t feel any consequences from extensive data clutter.”
Users are advised to take action to clear the clutter from their phone, tablet and computer with the following steps:

Complete an audit — ensure you know what information is stored where.
This will help you to clean devices more easily and give you peace of mind that your data is secure.
Clean your device — once you know where everything is stored, it is easy to delete unused and unwanted files and apps that may pose a risk to your device.
Update software — regular updates should be undertaken as soon as new versions are released.
Use dedicated software — software cleaners such as the one integrated into Kaspersky Lab’s flagship security solutions, scan all applications installed on your device and mark those posing potential risk or those that are rarely used.
It will also inform the user if the application slows down the user’s device, provides incomplete/incorrect information about its functions, operates in the background, and shows banners and messages without permission (e.g., advertising).
Kaspersky Lab’s flagship security solution for home users also contains an Application Manager feature that sends alerts if a program has been installed without their awareness or clear consent, for example, as additional software during the installation of another application.

One day in May 2016, Marion, a computer user from Germany, logged on to her home computer.
She had no idea what lay in store for her.
The first sign of trouble was when her computer did not boot up normally, and she couldn’t get to the desktop.
Even after a restart, nothing changed.
Then she saw the ransomware message on her screen.
She hadn’t spotted anything suspicious the last time she, or any other member of her family, had used the computer.
But there it was:

CryptXXX v3 ransom note
The rise of ransomware

Ransomware has been a growing problem for the past few years, and it shows no sign of slowing down.
We all know that it’s important to make backups on a regular basis, not to open suspicious e-mails, to use the best security software, and so on.
But still, anything can happen, and then you suddenly find yourself with inaccessible data on your PC, network shares, and attached hard drives.
You can’t make your PC 100% safe unless you disconnect it from any network, remove the CD drive, USB connections, and more.
This is rarely practical in today’s connected world.
So it’s time to get involved in risk management: to find your own personal balance of convenience, safety, and privacy.
And, if you should become a victim of a ransomware attack, you need to know that your decision isn’t a simple binary — to pay or not to pay.
Attackers are fixing the “bugs” that used to allow companies such as Kaspersky Lab and its partners to develop generic tools to decrypt files hit by various ransomware threats.
Today, ever more variants of increasingly sophisticated ransomware exist, and recovery often requires private keys from the criminals.
Getting your data back

As her day got gradually worse, Marion turned off her computer and asked the IT department at work for help.
They were able to capture all of the relevant data: the ransomware message, the related files on disk, and even some pictures and PDFs before and after encryption.
They tried all available tools to decrypt the files, but none worked.
No More Ransom saves the day

At that point, the full impact of what had happened to her PC hit Marion.
Her hard drive contained an archive with more than a decade’s worth of family pictures on it: years of special occasions, sorted into folders and organized by date.
Marion did not have an external backup, but she was sure of one thing: She was not going to pay any money to the criminals.
In this way she got some of them back.
But the majority remained lost.
With the help of her employer’s IT department, she looked online but couldn’t find a solution.
Finally, as a last resort, she put a post on Facebook asking for help and even offered a €500 reward to anyone who could help her to get her files back without paying the criminals!
(Translation: Though I received many hints from various helping hands, my files remain encrypted.
Looks like I got hit by a new variant.
But I won't give up the hope and raise the bounty to 500 euros for anyone who can help to decrypt my files.)
(Translation: Though I received many hints from various helping hands, my files remain encrypted.
Looks like I got hit by a new variant.
But I won’t give up the hope and raise the bounty to 500 euros for anyone who can help to decrypt my files.)
About 20 people replied to her post and tried to help.
However, none of them succeeded.
A former schoolmate of mine spotted Marion’s post and, knowing that my job is on the GReAT team at Kaspersky Lab, added me to the conversation.
I got in touch with Marion, and she provided all the relevant information so I could check for tools to decrypt her files.
But I couldn’t find any for the particular variant that had hit her.
With Marion’s information in hand, I asked our ransomware specialists for help.
They quickly confirmed that the malware was a new variant of CryptXXX V3 and that the specific tools to help her decrypt her files were not yet available.
I relayed the bad news to Marion but advised her not to pay the ransom — as attackers create new ransomware, we are working with law enforcement and other partners to develop decryption tools or to extract the private keys stored by criminals on their command-and-control servers.
We do this through the No More Ransom project.
In the summer of 2016, Europol, Kaspersky Lab, and Intel Security launched the NoMoreRansom.org portal to help ransomware victims recover their files, and to help disrupt the lucrative business model that keeps cybercriminals coming back for more.
The project now has more than 40 partners.
On the 20th of December, we added another decryptor for CryptXXX V3 to the No More Ransom page.
We offer it free of charge, like all of the ransomware tools you’ll find there.
I still had Marion’s case in my mind, so I contacted her on Facebook and pointed her to the new tool.
(Naturally, I wouldn’t take the reward.)
Lessons learned

I asked Marion what she had learned from this incident.
Besides doing regular backups of her data to different external hard drives, she’s now even more careful while surfing the Web and always makes sure she has the latest patches installed.
And she also stopped letting anyone else use her PC.
This takes the story back to the need for us all to be our own risk managers.
Ultimately, it’s up to you to look after your PC, network, privacy, and personal assets.
NoMoreRansom.org should be the first place to check — you could get your files back without having to pay anyone a cent.
Even if the solution for you doesn’t exist yet, give it some time and don’t pay the crooks.
Marion is just one of many beneficiaries of the No More Ransom project, which has so far released seven free decryption tools.
Five thousand users have unlocked their files, and saved more than $1.5 million in ransom, with its help.

We’ve already posted about Eugene Kaspersky and about a hundred other people being on their way to the Antarctic.
Well, neither Eugene nor his travel companions do such things on a regular basis, so you have to figure there’s a reason behind it.
The Antarctic Biennale: Cybersecurity meets science and art
What is the Antarctic Biennale

The Antarctic Biennale Expedition brings together approximately 100 participants — artists, researchers, and visionaries from all over the world — to explore and to think about a universal cultural future for Antarctica as a model of other “shared spaces” such as Ocean and Outer Space.
The art expedition started in Ushuaia, our planet’s southernmost city.
Alexander Ponomarev, artist, philosopher, and the project’s leader, believes the journey will be “a revolution that changes the vector.”
The core idea: a paradigm shift for the artists.
Drop the usual pavilions of the typical galleries in favor of the icy inaccessibility of the Antarctic.
Lose the comfortable apartments in favor of ascetic ship cabins.
Antarctic scenery and lots of talks with technical people are also outside of the norm for artists.
Each passenger on the ship can take part in discussions, poetry, and philosophy workshops as well as start designing the future in the Antarctic Biennale Vision club.
But the most important thing is that each expedition member will be an eyewitness and contributor to the art-making process.
Why is Kaspersky Lab sponsoring such an event?
Antarctica does not seem obviously relevant to the field of cybersecurity.
But we believe in creative people and creative decisions — be they business choices or the projects that we support.
Artists and scientists from all over the world will fulfill their most daring ideas in the remotest land on Earth.
The age of discovery was about geographical exploration, and the Biennale’s journey of discovery will be about opening the doors to cross-cultural encounters and communication, which aims to positively influence international cooperation.
Joint work developed by all participants will once again prove that collaboration and coexistence work better than tension and mistrust.
Eugene Kaspersky loves both art and expeditions.
It’s no surprise he’s on board of the Antarctic Biennale ship as well.
Actually, beyond the sponsorship, we’ve contributed to the project in a special way: our mission to save the world has inspired an Argentinean artist and engineer Joaquín Fargas to create the Glaciator.
We’re still aiming to save the world from viruses, but the Glaciator will target very, very old ones.
This robot will save the world by compressing snow.
We're still aiming to save the world from viruses, but the Glaciator will target very, very old ones.
This robot will save the world by compressing snow.
Here is some background: Since 2003, viruses have been found buried in permafrost, a layer of soil in the Antarctic that is usually permanently frozen (hence the name).
Rising temperatures and melting ice could result in the reappearance of ancient deadly viruses.
And it looks like all kinds of infection-causing viruses could defrost as the world warms — and, as you probably know, it is getting warmer and warmer.
So, Kaspersky Lab is sending a robot to keep the Earth safe from viruses — this time not in cyberspace, but in Antarctica.
The Glaciator compresses snow as it steps on it.
The robot is a “Firn-Maker.”
Firn is an intermediate state between snow and glacier ice.
Making firn accelerates the formation of a glacier.
And although we believe that being physically disconnected from the Internet makes Antarctica one of the safest places on Earth in terms of cybersecurity, we are not leaving anything to chance: Glaciator is protected by security software from Kaspersky Lab.
The Antarctic Biennale has just begun — the expedition has left the harbor and just crossed the Antarctic Circle.
It’s not easy to work on the ship.
While passing through the Drake Passage on the first day, some of the artists started suffering from seasickness, so schedules had to be rearranged.
Hey, nobody said it would be easy — and that’s part of the idea.
The sea is unusually calm, though, so there is hope that the situation will improve when the participants get their sea legs.
On March 20, the expedition crossed the South Polar Circle, meeting foggy, windy, and very humid weather — and its first icebergs.
That was also the first day back on land, and troubled stomachs unclenched a bit.
A long journey awaits.
The ship will harbor near several islands, and then the crew will set foot on the soil of the Antarctic continent.
After that, the ship will head to Cape Horn, and only then will it return to Argentina.
Of course the participants are taking a lot of pictures, so despite some data and bandwidth restrictions, we decided to live blog the expedition.

Modern smartphones have way more memory than desktop computers had a decade ago.
Out of space?
Why bother deleting anything when you can just replace your old 64GB memory card with new shiny 128GB card?
It doesn’t exactly cost a fortune.
The secret life of apps
For the most part, inexpensive storage is a good thing, but there’s a downside: With so much space, we don’t care anymore how many files and programs we store in our devices’ memory.
According to our research, on average, modern Android users have 66 apps installed on their smartphones or tablets.
Moreover, we typically install about a dozen new apps every month but delete only ten, effectively increasing the overall count by two every month.
The real problem is that you can’t control what all of those apps are doing.
According to Kaspersky Security Network data, 96 out of 100 Android apps start working without users launching them.
And 83 out of 100 apps have access to sensitive user data such as contacts, messages, calls history, files in storage, and so on.
We set up an experiment to check how the world’s top apps behave.
Of the 66 apps, 54 were running and consuming 22MB of data allowance per day — without the user even interacting with them.
Android operating system actually provides the ability to fine-tune data that apps can access.
It’s called the app permissions system.
However, people mostly ignore this powerful tool: only 40% of users always adjust permissions settings for every app.
Another issue with keeping a lot of unnecessary apps is vulnerabilities.
In general, people are not good about updating the programs installed on their devices: Only 65% of users update apps on their smartphones as soon as the newer versions are released, and 24% do so only when they are forced to.
The more apps you have, the less likely you are to update all of them right away — despite all Google’s efforts, updating still takes time and requires some clicking through.
And it’s not only users who are guilty of carelessness; developers are as well.
Our research shows that 88 of world’s top 300 Android apps are never updated, leaving users at risk of exploitation by cybercriminals.
All in all, you need to tend to your herd of apps.
Regarding that, we have some advice:

Don’t install tons of apps just for the sake of it.
Before downloading a new app from Google Play, think for a moment — do you really need this app?
Delete apps that you no longer use.
Get into the habit of cleaning up your installed apps list, say, on a monthly basis.
OK, let’s be realistic: Do it at least every couple of months.
Newer versions often include security fixes.
Google Play has a nice autoupdate feature for all apps that are downloaded from it.
It’s a handy feature, and we recommend using it.
Adjust app permissions settings.
It’s important to keep an eye on which apps have access to which sensitive data.
Here we have a thorough guide on Android permissions.
I doesn’t hurt to have a security app — antivirus for Android — that helps you check if any of those dozens of apps you install are malicious.

Password management is one of the most essential and yet probably the most annoying of security measures.
Short passwords are easy to remember, but they’re insecure; long and strong passwords are hard to remember — especially if you’re using unique ones, as you should do if you value security.
When it comes to smartphones, passwords are even more painful: strong and unique passwords are not only hard to remember, they’re actually hard to type with the tiny on-screen keypads of mobile devices.
Well, we have an easy solution for all these problems.
Never forget your passwords

Password Manager makes life much easier: Instead of memorizing dozens of passwords for this or that service, all you need to remember is a master password.
Actually, you don’t have to enter even this password every time you log in to Kaspersky Password Manager: Our app supports Touch ID.

Google said more than half of Android devices haven’t received a security update in the past year, and the percentage of potentially harmful apps running on devices installed from all sources rose in 2016.
The numbers come from the Android Security 2016 Year In Review (PDF) released Wednesday.
While the reports touts security gains made over the last year, it also highlights areas where security is lacking.

March Android Security Update Breaks SafetyNet, Android Pay
March 13, 2017 , 2:01 pm
By Q4 2016, Google said half of all Android devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year.
This past year was the first full year of Google’s monthly patches.
Google said overall the number of potentially harmful apps (PHA) downloaded from Google Play and including third-party apps stores running on Android devices rose to 0.71 percent in 2016, up from 0.5 percent in 2015 (PDF).
“Still, there’s more work to do for devices overall, especially those that install apps from multiple sources,” wrote co-authors of the report Adrian Ludwig, Google’s Director of Android Security, and Mel Miller, an Android security team member.
“Using improved tools and the knowledge we gained in 2016, we think we can reduce the number of devices affected by PHAs in 2017, no matter where people get their apps.”
On a positive note, in 2016 Google reported, on average, devices that only installed applications from Google Play had less than 0.05 percent of PHAs installed.
In 2015, that number was 0.15 percent.
Google said, during the past year it managed the security of 1.4 billion Android user devices.
In that timeframe, Google touted its work with wireless carriers, system on chip manufacturers and device makers to release security patches at a faster pace.
“Several manufacturers, including Samsung, LG and OnePlus, regularly deliver security updates to flagship devices on the same day as Google’s updates to Nexus and Pixel devices, thereby providing their customers with the most up-to-date security available,” according to Google.
Still, over the past year, security experts pointed to device patching as a major issue for Google in 2016 and the year ahead.
This past August, Google’s patching of the high-profile QuadRooter vulnerability took 96 days for it to go from vulnerability notification by Qualcomm to the release of the final patch for the critical flaws on Sept. 6.
Rich Smith, director of research and development for Duo Labs, blames carriers and manufacturers for hurting Google’s ability to speedily deploy patches.
“(They) are doing a much worse job and acting as a drag factor on the overall Android ecosystem when it comes to timely patching,” he said.
By Q4 2016, more than half of the top 50 Android devices worldwide had a “recent” security patch, Google said.
Smith points out that “recent” is a relative term.
“Our analysis suggests that ‘recent’ looks to be about 90 days,” he said.
Duo Labs analysis of one million enterprise Android devices shows 65 percent of Google’s own Nexus and Pixel hardware receive security patches within a 60-day window of being released.
And that 36 percent of what Google classifies as “top 50” Android devices receive a security patch within the first 60 days of availability.
After three months, 90 percent of Google’s own devices had patches compared to 81 percent of other “top 50” Android devices, according to Duo Labs.
“That number is pretty impressive when you consider the fact that devices that aren’t part of the Nexus or Pixel family are at the mercy of their OEM or carrier as to when (or if) they would receive these updates,” Smith said.
Mediaserver, Google noted in its report, also received a big update in 2016.
It was Android’s mediaserver, coupled with a security hole in Qualcomm’s Secure Execution Environment, which exposed 60 percent of Android devices to attack in 2016 as part of the QuadRooter vulnerability.
“We re-architected the mediaserver stack to address Stagefright-type vulnerabilities by adding integer overflow protections and compartmentalizing mediaserver’s components into individual sandboxes with minimal privileges.
We also increased the degree of randomness in address space layout randomization (ASLR), making some attacks more difficult,” Google said.
“The overall health of Google Play has increased year over year.
The number of installed trojans dropped by 51.5 percent, hostile downloaders dropped by 54.6 percent, backdoors dropped by 30.5 percent, and phishing apps dropped by 73 percent,” wrote Ludwig and Miller.
A report on ransomware sheds new light on attacks in 2016, starting with the fact that 48 percent of businesses hit by ransomware said they paid the ransom.
That’s in spite of pleas from cyber security experts and the FBI not to do so.
Other insights include the average ransom payment was $2,500 with 7 percent of respondents admitting to paying more than $10,000 to get their data back.
The Ponemon Institute study, titled “The Rise of Ransomware” and sponsored by backup company Carbonite, found by far that most ransomware attacks stemmed from phishing and social engineering ploys.
Another 30 percent of respondents said they were lured in by insecure or spoofed websites.

“Fifty-eight percent of respondents say negligent employees put their company at risk for a ransomware attack,” the report said.
The study (PDF) was based on 618 respondents comprised mainly of IT contractors, managers and business owners reporting directly to a business CISO.
Data culled from these sources suggest ransomware worries will continue well into 2017.
Only a quarter of respondents expressed confidence that their current security would protect their company from future ransomware attacks.
“An average of one or more ransomware infections go undetected per month and are able to bypass their organization’s IPS and/or AV systems, according to 44 percent of respondents,” according to the study.
Trends such as the growth of Internet of Things and connected devices will increase the threat landscape, they said.
When it comes to the types of ransomware, 80 percent of survey respondents said they were hit by crypto ransomware and 20 percent of respondents say their company experienced locker ransomware, which prevents access to the computer until a ransom is paid.
Forty-six percent of victims were given fewer than two days to pay a ransom while 16 percent said attackers placed no time limit on paying the ransom.
Compromised data related to ransomware attacks is also a topic of great concern among its victims.
Of those attacked, more than half of victims are fairly sure that data was removed from compromised devices.
Obviously, the loss of confidential data is only one of many ransomware headaches businesses face.
Thirty-three percent of respondents said the top true cost of ransomware is having to invest in new security defenses.
Another 32 percent said the loss of revenue due to business downtime and also the loss of customers were both the biggest contributors to the economic impact of ransomware.
Much to the disappointment of the FBI, almost half (49 percent) of respondents said there were too afraid of public scrutiny to report ransomware attacks to law enforcement.
The FBI has been a loud advocate for ransomware victims to come forward, arguing “a Bitcoin wallet address, transaction data, the hashtag of the malware, or any email correspondence, it can help advance an FBI ransomware investigation.”
Despite those pleas from law enforcement, 17 percent of companies said they didn’t notify the authorities because they didn’t believe the ransom demand was exorbitant.
Another 10 percent said they were afraid going to the authorities out of fear it might motivate additional attacks.
The best way to avoid paying a ransom?
Backup your data and systems.
Of the 52 percent of respondents that said they were hit by a ransomware attack, but didn’t pay the ransom, they cited having a full backup as to why, according to the study.
InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), parent company to Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Kimpton Hotels and Resorts, confirmed on Friday a breach of payment card systems used in 12 of its hotels located in North America and the Caribbean.
According to IHG, which operates 5,000 hotels worldwide, malware was found on servers used to process credit cards.
The servers were infected between last August and December; the company declined to say how many payment cards were impacted.

The Changing Face of Carbanak
January 19, 2017 , 3:35 pm
In a statement released Friday, IHG said it found malware installed on servers used at popular destinations such as Michael Jordan’s Steak House and Bar in Chicago, the Holiday Inn San Francisco Fisherman’s Wharf, the Copper Lounge in Los Angeles, and the Palm Bar in Aruba.
A full list of locations impacted was posted by IHG.
The hotelier reported on Dec. 28 that it was investigating customer complaints of unauthorized charges on credit cards.
At the time, the company said only a limited number of destinations were impacted before revealing more details on Friday.
“Findings show that malware was installed on servers that processed payment cards used at restaurants and bars of 12 IHG managed properties,” according to a statement.
“Cards used at the front desk of these properties were not affected.”
According to IHG, the malware searched for magnetic stripe track data as it was being routed through servers.
Track data included cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code.
There is also no information provided on the strain of malware used in the attacks.
Hotels, restaurants and other hospitality outlets are frequently singled out as victims of opportunistic hackers.
Last year alone there were nearly a dozen reports of card breaches.
Similarly, malware was used to siphon payment card data.
The prevalence of malware use to steal payment card data hit a peak in 2014 when it was at the center of several high-profile breaches, including Target and Neiman Marcus.
As recently as last November, security researchers at Trustwave said the Carbanak cybercrime gang, first discovered by Kaspersky Lab, had shifted strategy and began targeting the hospitality and restaurant industries with new techniques and malware.
Part of the Carbanak tactics involved targeting hospitality call centers with elaborate ploys to get customer service representatives to accept and download emails with malicious macro-laced documents.
The target was credit card data scraped from the memory of point-of-sale systems.
“We have been working with the security firms to review our security measures, confirm that this issue has been remediated, and evaluate ways to enhance our security measures,” IHG wrote in a statement regarding the breach.
SAN FRANCISCO – Security researchers say a new trend in privateering is gaining traction among nation states, which are increasingly contracting with private companies to carry out state-sponsored attacks.
Typically APT attacks have been the work of  internal government spy apparatuses, but outsourcing allows nation states to shift risk, dodge attribution claims and take advantage of more sophisticated APT tools available on the black market, according to a report by Cybereason’s Intelligence Unit, released Tuesday at the RSA Conference.

Cybereason said China, Russia and United Arab Emirates are three of many countries that are increasingly outsourcing targeted operations to individual hacking groups and companies that range from established organizations, to ones created out of whole cloth for the sole purpose of an APT campaign.
“This trend has been slowly building over the last five years.
Over the last year to year-and-a-half, the number of operators in this space have grown large enough to merit an investigation,” said Ross Rustici, associate director, intelligence research, Cybereason.
Cybereason’s report singles out a number of Chinese firms as examples of a private company carrying out attacks on the behalf of China’s equivalent of the National Security Agency.
Threatpost attempted to contact China-based Bo Yu Guangzhou Information Technology which was named in the report and did not get responses in time for publication.
Given their relationship with government, these companies likely have tacit permission to operate against foreign entities as long as the activity doesn’t produce significant issues for the government,” the report states.
Having private firms spy for nation states isn’t new.
“This method, long used by Chinese human intelligence operators has transferred over into the cyber arena,” according to the report.
“In some ways, this is a very old story,” Rustici said.
“However, given the centrality of attribution in both state-level cyber interactions and in understanding private sector intrusions, we felt that this phenomenon merited further discussion.”
According to Cybereason’s analysis, these types of privatized state-sponsored APT campaigns have been successful at accomplishing low to mid-tier goals.
China, according to Cybereason, is leading the trend in APT outsourcing.
Unlike past reliance by China on it People’s Liberation Army (PLA) hacking unit, more recent attacks are being carried out by full-fledge independent China-based companies that typically offer security solutions as covers for their spying apparatus.
“One of the drivers appears to be the increasing nature of public attribution and the need for more clandestine, plausibly deniable, operations.
It is far easier to hire a group of outsiders and then arrest them if they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar than say a member of the military,” Rustici said.
Past APT attacks have outsourced pieces of a campaign, but few have farmed out the entire platform as they are now, said the report.
Private Chinese companies that align with the Ministry of State Security’s intelligence and security agency goals and targets, have been caught and identified, Cybereason said.
But none of those have ever been tied back to China’s MSS, said Cybereason.
“This demonstrates the significant advantage outsourcing has over indigenous capabilities, especially for organizations that have a significant risk, should they be exposed,” the report states.
Besides attribution, another driver of this trend is a reduction in the time and money required to find, develop, and build exploits and malware against specific hard systems, Cybereason reports.
“This means that there is an ever-increasing pool of highly talented and sophisticated hackers going after increasingly unique systems,” according to the report.
The U.S. government’s role in vulnerability disclosures is a vital part of our national security and should be codified in law, said a group of policy experts at a panel discussion last week at the RSA Conference.
The panelists argued that the government’s current process of vulnerability use and disclosure, called Vulnerability Equities Process (VEP), is voluntary and should be protected by law.
“With a new administration, there is concern it might wield its powers over the government’s security apparatus and that would include the VEP,” said Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution and former attorney for the National Security Agency.
“There is an appetite to put additional protections in place around the VEP so that it is protected from the discretions of the federal government.”

VEP is a controversial process that resides in the NSA that determines whether the government should withhold or disclose information about computer security vulnerabilities.
Iterations of the VEP have existed in some form since 2008.
Its existence didn’t become widely known until 2016 when the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act in order to gain access to the VEP.
Ever since then, the VEP has been a lightning rod for government critics who have long claimed the process isn’t transparent enough and protects government security researchers whom critics claim stockpile discovered and purchased vulnerabilities for intelligence operations.
VEP criticism hit a high watermark in 2014 when the federal government was accused of having advanced knowledge of the Heartbeed bug and not warning the public.
That’s a claim the NSA denies.
According to panelist Heather West, a senior policy manager for Mozilla, the VEP may be imperfect, but it’s the best the U.S. has in terms of a government vulnerability disclosure policy.
“From our perspective, it’s time for this process to be codified in law,” West said.
“We need to make sure it continues to operate at the level it is today.”
She acknowledged there could be a lot more transparency and accountability in the process, but argues the framework that exists today for vulnerability disclosure by the U.S. government is the envy of the world and needs to be preserved.
What is known about the VEP comes from a heavily redacted document released in January 2016.
Briefly, it lays the groundwork for when the government should disclose a vulnerability.
It weighs many criteria for disclosure such as how likely is it that others will discover the vulnerability, how badly the vulnerability is needed to obtain intelligence, and what are the risks posed and the harm that could be done if the vulnerability is left unpatched.
“We need to move from what is an interagency agreement to substantiate VEP into law,” said Rob Knake senior fellow with The Council on Foreign Relations and Former Director for Cybersecurity Policy at the White House National Security Council.
“I think it’s time to put a legal framework around this process.
It’s something the intelligence industry and the software industry are looking for and we hope the administration is listening.”
Knake and other panelists said making VEP law would inspire trust in the vulnerability disclosure process by its skeptics.
He also said legal accountability would force the NSA to be more transparent in its VEP oversight.
Currently the VEP is an administrative policy, not law nor executive order.
“Right now there are no penalties for individuals to hold back information,” Knake said.
“If you’re concerned about accountability, then making VEP law offers a lot of fringe benefits from congressional oversight to individual accountability.”
Neil Jenkins director of the Enterprise Performance Management Office with the Department of Homeland Security, said the VEP processes was reinvigorated over the past few years by the Obama administration.
Its goal, he said, is responsible and speedy disclosure of vulnerabilities and working with the private sector on patching.
“It’s not in our national interest to build up a stockpile of vulnerabilities to hide behind for intelligence purposes.
Jenkins said, currently government researchers find 100 vulnerabilities a year with about two percent withheld from the VEP for intelligence purposes.
“In a small number of cases, where we do restrict dissemination of the vulnerability, we look at those vulnerabilities regularly and make a determination every three to six months as to whether to release them,” he said.
During the discussion, panelists mostly sidestepped thornier questions that came up such as whether the government’s vulnerability disclosure policies currently skewed toward offensive purposes versus defensive purposes.
However when it came to the hot-button issue of the government buying vulnerabilities, panelist Knake advocated a new approach.
“I’d like to see the U.S. government actively looking for more vulnerabilities and supporting the research community.
I also think they should push the vast majority of those vulnerabilities back to companies and only use vulnerabilities they need for a very short time,” he said.
Knake said by accelerating the pace of discovering and buying vulnerabilities and then disclosing them, it would raise the bar for security across the board.
“I love the notion of a beautiful virtuous cycle of finding vulnerabilities and patching them and then finding more,” Hennessey said.
“I wouldn’t hold your breath that will happen anytime soon.”
She argued cost of the strategy would be too high when it came to government vulnerability research.
She added the more often the U.S. government paid for vulnerabilities the higher it would drive the cost up in the market for vulnerabilities.
“That plan also doesn’t account for the fragility of intelligence.
It’s not so easy to replace one unknown vulnerability with another.
Whenever the government doesn’t have those vulnerabilities it makes their job even more difficult,” Hennessey said.
A a panel of security experts at the RSA Conference on Wednesday said there is a lack of agreement on a definition of cyberwarfare and of the tools used to fight them.
“Words matter and it’s important to have definitions.
But one of the challenges is the pace of innovation gets in front of doctrine and law.
Only a few years ago the notion of warfare in cyberspace would be akin to if something blows up or a digital Pearl Harbor.
But what we have seen over the years is that the future warfare between two enemies might be only the targeting of data, information or it might be financial based,” said panelist Oren Falkowitz, CEO and co-founder of Area 1 Security.

Gary Brown, professor of cyber security at Marine Corps University said this dynamic presents a different context for cyberwarfare.
“As we go forward and as the lawyers debate what the traditional outlines of what cyber weaponry are, we are moving beyond the type of incident we had with Stuxnet.
Cyberwarfare involves the targeting of data or information,” Brown said.
Modern-day tactics when it comes to launching an attack, they say, are radically different than the grandfather of digital weapons Stuxnet used six years ago.
Today attacks can be launched between two nations without concrete knowledge of a direct assault or attribution as to who is behind them.
And the tactics used, by comparison to Stuxnet, are mundane, and could include something as rudimentary as an effective phishing attack, Falkowitz said.
“It’s important to define things in the field, not just for the many legal reasons, but because in this area we are still setting expectations between states.
One of the things that is important when it comes to international relations is making sure states understand what the other nation is trying to do.
We debate all the time did this act cross some threshold into an armed conflict.
So it’s important we have some shared understanding,” Brown said.
The traditional definitions put forth by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare written in 2012 have lost a bit relevancy when it comes to defining what cyberwarfare is today, Brown said.
Espionage, theft of data and attacks on financial institutions by unknown adversaries are aren’t acts of war, but become part of a cyber operation as one state fights another, said Roy Katmor, co-founder and CEO of enSilo.
In Israel, cyber attacks against an adversary are considered part of the cyber operations, Katmor said.
Instruments used in those cyber operations include what many considered tools of espionage, not strictly cyber weapons that attack physical assets, he said.
But identifying cyberwarfare and weapons is not just a game of semantics.
Panelists agree common definitions of what cyberwarfare is helps define the tools needed to fight them.
“There is not a great need for people to have these elaborate (hacking) toolkits.
Ninety-seven percent of all cyber incidents start with something as basic as a phishing attack,” Falkowitz said.
So how does that shape how one nation state wages cyberwarfare against another?
Today cyberwarfare is less about targeting “things” with weapons, and more about affecting and undermining systems, Falkowitz said.
The bonus of keeping attacks simple and effective, it makes the arduous task of assigning attribution to cyber weapons or assaults even more difficult.
An attack that uses a commodity malware with a generic power-shell command-and-control could be perpetrated by any number of criminal actors.
That makes it almost impossible to understand the intent of the attack as opposed to having a digital fingerprint traceable to a nation state attacker, Katmor said.
From the early days of the iPhone, the CIA has had an interest in compromising the flagship Apple mobile device, according to the latest WikiLeaks release of CIA documents.
Today’s Vault 7 Dark Matter release shows an unsurprising interest from the intelligence agency in tracking iPhone users, as well as capabilities in developing implants and exploits targeting Mac firmware running on Macbooks.

The iPhone attack documentation for the CIA’s NightSkies tools describes a beacon dating back to 2008, purpose-built for factory iPhones, indicating the CIA’s ability to interdict the Apple supply chain and install this tool.
“Intelligence agencies used to put these beacons in someone’s car and track its radio signals.
Modern beacons infest iPhones and report over the internet the location of an iPhone and other information from the phone,” said WikiLeaks founder, exiled publisher Julian Assange, during a press conference aired over the WikiLeaks Periscope account.
“Noteworthy is that NightSkies reached version 1.2 in 2008, indicating that it was in the process of being developed for some time,” Assange said.
“It is expressly designed be physically installed on factory-fresh iPhones, not phones that are stolen and then have the malware implanted, but in an iPhone before you get it.”
A request for comment from Apple was not returned in time for publication.
Assange said the CIA’s Embedded Development Branch (EDB) is responsible for developing these tools, and the group’s documentation shows the agency’s interest in not only targeting iPhones and Macbooks, but also maintaining a persistent presence on those devices that would survive a reinstallation of the Apple operating system.
The release comes two weeks after the first Vault 7 release on March 7.
The initial batch of documents were dated between 2013 and 2016 and included documentation on compromises for all the major modern browsers, smartphones, Windows, macOS and Linux computers and smart televisions.
Cisco was the first vendor last Friday to warn its customers about a vulnerability affecting more than 300 of its routers and switches.
The company still has not patched the flaws.
Today’s dump of CIA documents shows how the agency concentrated on developing malware and exploits that would attack the firmware running on Macs and iPhones, specifically EFI and UEFI firmware.
The Sonic Screwdriver project, for example, is an exploit that targets peripherals and executes as a Mac boots up, bypassing the protection afforded by an Apple Firmware Password, which prevents alterations of the boot path.
“The code for the Sonic Screwdriver is stored on the firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter,” the documentation states.
“The implant code will scan all internal and external media for a device with a specific volume name.”
Once the volume is found on a USB, CD or hard drive, it will execute a UEFI boot of that device.
The documentation also describes an implant called DarkSeaSkies, an EFI implant for Macbook Air laptops that includes the DarkMatter EFI implant, a kernel-space implant called SeaPea, and the NightSkies beacon/implant.
Another manual describing an implant called Triton for MacOS X machines and an EFI-persistent implant called DerStarke were also part of today’s dump.
DerStarke dates back to 2013, but Assange said that the CIA continued to update these tools through last year and has begun work on version 2.0.
Assange said that WikiLeaks reached out to the technology vendors impacted in the first Vault 7 dump, contacting on March 12 Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla and others.
Assange said Cisco was proactive in reaching out to WikiLeaks for information, and that no exploits were shared with Cisco, but that the description in the March 7 dump was enough for Cisco to work out the issue.
Mozilla, meanwhile, responded on March 12 and Assange said it agreed to WikiLeaks’ disclosure terms which match industry standards that include a 90-day disclosure deadline, and secure points of contact that include encryption keys.
MikroTik, a manufacturer of VoIP controllers targeted by the CIA replied similarly on March 15, but Google and Microsoft, which both replied March 20, pointed WikiLeaks instead to their respective disclosure terms, Assange said.
Problems with hardcoded credentials are hitting consumer IoT devices, industrial SCADA devices, and even critical infrastructure.
Despite the appeal on source code and firmware audition, this type of vulnerability recurs and threatens users’ privacy and data security.
Security researcher Elliot Williams posted on Hackaday that most GSM-to-IP devices made by DBLTek have a remotely accessible hardcoded credential which leads to a shell with root privileges.
The finding was reported to the manufacturer, who didn’t really fix the underlying vulnerability.
Instead, they implemented a workaround: they added an extra challenge-response process, whose algorithm can be obtained by reverse-engineering.
Trustwave’s blog post summarizes the entire chain of events.
A tool exploiting this vulnerability is also available on Github.
On Shodan, a search engine for Internet-connected devices, I was able to find exposed DBLTek GoIP devices both with and without the extra “challenge”.
Randomly tested devices showed that they were updated to the newer firmware with a challenge-response.
Shodan search for vulnerable DBLTek devices

A compromised GoIP device might cause security risks to VoIP software which is usually on a LAN, resulting in unauthorized inbound/outbound calls, access to voicemail boxes, SIP trunks, and lateral movement.
Since it may also work in router mode (which works like a home router), a compromised device can also lead to risks for computers behind it.
Trend Micro recommends against connecting IoT and VoIP gateway products directly to the Internet, as this leaves these devices without the benefit of the protection provided by a router.
Based on the incidents we saw in 2016, I recommend that organizations enter 2017 with caution.
From the growth of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks to cybercriminals using more effective ways to exploit Internet of Things (IoT) devices, these security issues should serve as a reminder for businesses and individuals to be more vigilant.
Looking ahead, one of the most pressing matters that a lot of organizations need to pay attention to is the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The new set of rules is designed to harmonize data protection across all EU member states and bring in a number of key components that will directly impact businesses—including businesses outside Europe.
Much has been said about the GDPR, but what is the most realistic data protection design for organizations?
This should be the one of the questions you need to ask yourself as a business.
My answer to that would be only collect what you need to collect.
How much personal information do you really need to collect?
For example, a customer’s birthday might not be pertinent to your business—so you must get rid of it.
If you have an existing collection of data that is not required to do business, then you need to redesign the database and drop these unnecessary fields.
During the transition period until the GDPR takes effect in May 2018, organizations have to prepare to be compliant.
Here are some of the common compliance issues your company could face:

Fines – the GDPR maintains that non-compliance or violations could cost companies up to 4% of global annual turnover, or €20 million, in administrative fines

Data Breach Notification – the new regulation will require companies to notify the data protection supervisory authority of data breaches within 72 hours

Right to erasure – to emphasize my earlier statement, only collect what you need to collect.
This means companies have to delete personal data and any related links if they no longer find it accurate or relevant to the business

Right to information and transparency – customers should have the right to opt out and have a very clear understanding of how you store their personal data and what you do with it.
In Trend Micro’s 2017 Security Predictions, we said that the GDPR is expected to raise administrative costs, but the extent will really depend on what the companies are doing at the moment.
Most European companies are already bound by local regulations within the countries, so adapting to the GDPR should not be so difficult because some of them already have even stricter rules.
However, in other countries, especially where businesses store customer data for marketing purposes, they will need to do a complete redesign of their database to comply with the GDPR.
Companies should factor in the fines for non-compliance.
In TalkTalk’s case, where it was hit with a record £400,000 fine for not having proper website security, that fine could possibly amount to millions if the GDPR was already in effect.
So companies should be taking their data protection practices more seriously, especially with the impending regulation.
Companies in Europe are worried about the implementation costs, while companies in the US believe that they will pay fines because they cannot comply.
I predict that in 2018, companies who do not comply will not only suffer fines but managers could risk going to jail as well in case of intentional violations with the purpose of enrichment or impairment —which could lead to serious implications on your business’s reputation.
Consequently, I expect small law firms to make money by finding customers who can testify against non-compliant businesses and sue them.
Is there enough time to prepare until May 2018?
It should be because companies already know that it is coming, as GDPR was adopted in April 2016.
Since it has been under discussion in the European Parliament for five years, organizations must already be aware and act on their compliance strategies as early as now.
While the GDPR could be burdensome for many companies, it’s not all doom and gloom.
It will still ultimately teach companies to apply better security practices on data handling, which will increase customer trust and enhance technological neutrality.
Here’s what you can do to prepare:

Know where your data is stored – The GDPR dictates that “personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.”
Make sure that you don’t store more information than you need for that purpose.
Use well-established security controls – reassess security policies and invest in a provider that can offer encryption of data in the cloud, network security, advanced anti-malware, IDS/IPS virtual patching and data loss prevention.
Designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if you are an enterprise – in line with the GDPR requirements, you might have to seek legal advice to determine if your company should designate a DPO or not.
If you are an enterprise and not an SMB, you are more likely to need one.
A DPO would help the IT department and the board improve data protection processes and security, and will be tasked to monitor compliance with the data protection provisions.
From the looks of it, many companies both in and outside Europe will have a tough time adhering to these new regulations.

We updated the appropriate cost of fines and timeline.
Based on an INTERPOL survey featured in a joint Trend Micro-INTERPOL research paper, West African cybercriminals stole an average of US$2.7 million from businesses and an average of US$422,000 from individuals from 2013 to 2015.
Scams or various types of fraud, whether simple (like 419 or Nigerian prince scams) or complex (like business email compromise [BEC] scams), run rampant in the West African threat landscape.
In fact, most of the online scams we see now may have to do with the increase in the region’s cybercriminal activity volume.
While conducting research on cybercrime in West Africa, we stumbled upon a scamming operation dubbed “Z*N.” In it, the cybercriminal uses keyloggers to gather the email credentials of employees in order to hijack ongoing financial transactions.
As such, hijacked funds ended up in accounts that the cybercriminal control.
The cybercriminal mistakenly installed the keylogger onto his own computer.
This “slip” allowed us to access his logs and find details about him (personal data) and his operation.
It also gave us an insight into what goes on in a typical scamming operation:



Figure 1.
Steps in a typical scamming operation

Profiling the West African Cybercriminal

West African cybercriminals can be classified into two major types—Yahoo! boys and next-level cybercriminals.
They are around 20−29 years old and have basic technical know-how and so run simpler scams (advance-fee, stranded-traveler, and romance scams).
They communicate with fellow cybercriminals through social media and typically follow a ringleader or mastermind.
Next-level cybercriminals, meanwhile, run more complex scams akin to “long cons” (tax and BEC scams).
They are more tech-savvy and frequent underground forums to obtain tools like malware.
Trend Micro and Law Enforcement Collaboration

The volume of cybercriminal activities in West Africa has been increasing.
And the region’s cybercriminals are evolving—going for more complex than simpler scams to gain more profit.
Are we bound to see a West African underground market emerge soon?
Although 30% of all the cybercrime reported to law enforcement agencies in West Africa lead to arrests, roadblocks like obtaining information from overseas and finding cybercriminals’ actual physical locations still exist.
This is especially true for money mules (in next-level cybercriminals’ networks) who reside abroad.
Typically, money mules are fellow West Africans who have bank accounts in the countries their affiliates wish to steal money from.
Only a few money mules get arrested though.
This could be due to the fact that mules reside outside West Africa and so are no longer part of the region’s police jurisdiction.
West African law enforcement agencies thus focus more on arresting IT  technicians (who take care of an operation’s infrastructure) and fraud operators (who actually engage in social engineering activities), especially since they reside within the region.
Trend Micro will continue collaborating with agencies like INTERPOL to thwart cybercrime.

Mediaserver Vulnerabilities Highlight Android’s March Security Bulletin
Posted on:March 22, 2017 at 12:00 am
Posted in:Mobile, Vulnerabilities
Author: Trend Micro

The Android security bulletin for March, published last March 6, contains 15 vulnerabilities that we discovered and privately disclosed to Google.
Like some of our previous discoveries, many of these new vulnerabilities concern Mediaserver, which is the component responsible for scanning and indexing all available media files in the Android operating system.
Google encourages owners of Android-based devices to avoid any potential issues by accepting their over-the-air (OTA) update which address these vulnerabilities.
However, it should also be noted that Google can only directly update devices that are using native Android operating systems.
As such, users who are unable to directly receive these updates may need to confirm with their service providers or device manufacturers to see if an update is available.
Vulnerability details

Of the 15 vulnerabilities, eight were rated Critical: An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities can use specially crafted files – specifically H.264 and H.265 videos- to cause memory corruption during file processing.
In addition, these new vulnerabilities can potentially allow attackers to run remote code executions via Mediaserver processes.
However, unlike the earlier vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-3823 and CVE-2015-3824 which were caused primarily by bad media format parsing, the newest batch is caused by issues surrounding the media decoder codec.
In addition to these, we also discovered additional vulnerabilities which were rated by Google as High severity.
These particularly vulnerabilities involve a denial of service attack, in which the perpetrator can use crafted media files to trigger an indefinite Mediaserver loop.
This causes the target device to become extremely sluggish and can even cause random reboots.
While the denial of service itself is easy to trigger, Android has enhanced the security features of Mediaserver making it more difficult to compromise the device itself.
We also reported a third Mediaserver vulnerability, which was rated by Google as of Moderate severity.
CVE-2017-0495 is an information disclosure vulnerability which fetches data from the Mediaserver memory.
The main purpose of this vulnerability is to get other vulnerabilities, particularly remote code executions, working.
A Moderate priority information disclosure vulnerability dealing with AOSP Messaging and Android Messages rounds up our reported discoveries for March.
Cybercriminals exploiting CVE-2017-0494 can use specially crafted GIF files to gain access to potentially sensitive data in the Messaging app beyond their normal permission levels.
Best Practices and Trend Micro Solutions

Many of these vulnerabilities require a specially crafted file before they can be exploited, thus users should be aware of the websites they visit – particularly online streaming video sites that can trigger these exploits.
In addition, these vulnerabilities can be nipped in the bud by regularly applying the latest patches from Google.
End users can protect their mobile devices by downloading Trend Micro Mobile Security (TMMS), which can detect threats that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities.

How is it possible for users to lose hundreds of dollars in anomalous online bank transfers when all of their gadgets have security software installed?
Last year, user Y, who is based in Brazil, lost R$600 (US$191.02, as of January 30, 2017) as a side effect of information theft.
Upon discovering this, Y immediately called an IT technician to find the root cause.
The technician originally chalked up the incident to Y accessing a fake website.
But since no malware was found in the devices connected to the network, he then reviewed the home router settings.
What he found was interesting:  even though the home router did not expose any remote management interface to the internet, the DNS settings were still modified.
As a solution, the IT technician reset and reconfigured the home router to stop cybercriminals from making further bank transfers.
In another case, user X noticed R$3,000 (US$955.11, as of January 30, 2017) was deducted from her account last January 2016.
Her home router was also infected with a malicious DNS-changing malware.
But instead of bank websites, cybercriminals redirected her to spoofed pages of third-party sites used by banks, such as Google Adsense™ and JQuery.
For one, security flaws exist in the operating system, firmware, and web applications of routers.
Attackers can simply use these vulnerabilities as entry points to further compromise the home network.
In fact, there are a few tools and websites that  cybercriminals use to find vulnerable routers and obtain exploits for their attacks.
Below is an example of such website:



Figure 1.
A trading website that displays a list of home router exploits (Click to enlarge)

Predefined credentials in routers make it easy for web-based scripts  to bypass device authentication mechanisms and allow cybercriminals to perform  brute-force attacks.
Web-based scripts are an effective tactic to infiltrate routers.
Another security gap are remote administration features in router firmware that cybercriminals can abuse to function as “built-in backdoors.”
This could lead to a plethora of problems: remote code execution,  modified router settings to redirect to phishing or malicious pages,  and man-in-the-middle attacks, among others.
Vendors should make it a point to find and remove these backdoors in their products before attackers do.
Are home routers safe?
It’s easy to overlook router security in a home setting since most home router attacks are isolated cases or have very minimal effect on a user’s bandwidth.
Unless a user experiences attacks like the ones mentioned above, router security is the least of a user’s concerns.
This can be a problematic mindset moving forward.
What home users need to understand is that home routers serve as a gateway in and out of their home.
All the information coming from the internet will have to pass through it.
Routers are their private property, and any form of compromise is like a form of trespassing.
Some router threats that take advantage of its communications with connected devices can even make home users unwitting accomplices to cybercriminal activities.
Case in point, the Mirai botnet took advantage of unsecure IoT devices for different attacks last year.
When the source code was leaked in a hacking forum, we saw new Mirai strains in the wild.
Affected entities like small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) may have to deal with business disruption, damaged reputation, or even productivity and profit loss.
Figure 2.
Top countries affected by Mirai (August 2016- December 2016) (Click to enlarge)

 Mirai uses a predefined list of default credentials to infect devices.
Knowing this, it is essential for home users to change router passwords.
This measure can provide an additional layer of security.
As we mentioned in our 2017 Security Predictions, the likelihood of Mirai-like threats used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks may increase this year, so it’s necessary to take precautions.
Apart from botnet clients, other threats like rootkits that specifically infect Linux can also be dangerous to routers.
Voice over IP (VoIP) fraud, which taps the telephony service in routers, could amount to additional charges in a user’s phone or internet bills.
How can home users protect their routers?
The first step in protecting home routers is choosing reliable ones.
Some routers, like that of ASUS, are now bundled with security features.
Trend Micro recently partnered with the brand to address home network security risks.
ASUS routers come with features like deep packet inspection and web threat protection that filter threats before they reach users’ devices.
Aside from selecting a secure router, users should also change the default router password to thwart brute-force attacks.
Regular checking of DNS settings can also aid users and SMBs to spot anything suspicious in their network.
If a user’s router has a firewall, they should enable it as another form of protection against threats.

In 2016, 91 percent of the U.S. population had health insurance coverage which means at a given time, any person will be effected in the event of a healthcare data breach.
How it affects individuals may differ case by case perspective, but its impact to affected people and healthcare institutions are far from mild.
In our latest research paper titled Cybercrime and Other Threats Faced by Healthcare Industry, we look at the other side of a healthcare data breach and trace back what happens to electronic health records (EHR) after they are stolen.
The multiple uses of Electronic Health Records on the Deep Web

An EHR is a data set that contains personally identifiable information (PII), financial information such as insurance data, payment transactions, as well as personal health related information such as medical prescriptions, history records, appointment schedules, and other medical related information used by physicians.
Each of those data sets are items that have value to cybercriminals.
Financial information and PII are the data that are usually lost in data breaches and sold in underground markets.
However, what about health related information?
Are cybercriminals interested in physician’s appointments or medication taken by the victim?
Healthcare documents sold in the Underground

Monetizing raw data such as PII is nothing new in the Underground.
What makes EHR in the Underground so different is that some of the data can be used to create a whole new list of offerings.
These wares include fraudulent documents like tax returns or fake IDs, fake driver’s licenses or birth certificates, but also stolen prescriptions with which the buyer can buy drugs.
This gives them access to controlled substances such as Ambien, a popular sleep disorder medication known to be abused by many users.
Figure 2.
Ambien sold in the Underground

Not just stolen data

Cyberattacks against hospitals, healthcare providers and doctors cost the U.S. healthcare industry more than estimated $6 billion a year with an average data breach costing a hospital around $2.1 million.
As for the victims, 65 percent of medical identity fraud victims end up paying an average of $13,500 on legal fees and creditor service fees when trying to resolve the issue.
Compared to other breaches, victims that lost their healthcare data experience more difficulties dealing with the breach.
Unlike credit card breaches, medical identify theft can take more than three months before it is reported.
Victims might not even know they were affected since credit bureaus wait 180 days after a service to charge one’s line of credit.
This can effectively ruin personal credit scores.
To make matters worse, EHR contains data that does not expire like date of birth, social security numbers, and so on.
This means that cybercriminals can reuse the victim’s information over and over.
After EHR in the underground is sold, victims have no way of knowing whether their records have been tampered with or modified by someone who could have bought and then used their stolen profile.
The actual impact on manipulated documents and fraudulent use are still unclear.

A worm was found in the safe garden of Apple.
About 40 iOS apps are now being cleaned out of the App Store because they turned out to be infected with malicious code, which had been designed to build a botnet out of Apple devices.
XcodeGhost malware for iOS detected
The malware XcodeGhost affected dozens of apps, including: WeChat app (600+ million users), NetEase’s music downloading app, business card scanner CamCard, and Didi Kuaidi’s Uber-like car hailing app.
To make matters worse, the Chinese versions of Angry Birds 2 was infected – is nothing sacred anymore?
Apple spends a lot of time and effort to monitor each and every app in the Apple Store.
These efforts set App Store apart from Google Play and third-party stores, which were literally stalked by malicious software (at least until Google launched it’s own malware scanning system in 2014).
Against this background, September 2015 seems to be especially unsuccessful for Apple as experts found malware that targeted jailbroken devices and everybody spoke about the “biggest theft ever involving Apple accounts,” and now Palo Alto Networks company has found compromised software on the App Store.

What is Xcode, and what exactly is XcodeGhost?
Xcode is a free suite of tools used by software developers to create apps for iOS and Apple Store.
XcodeGhost is malicious software, designed to affect the Xcode and thereby compromise apps, created with infected tools.
Allegedly 40 or even more apps on #AppStore are infected #Apple #malware

Tweet
How were the apps compromised?
Apple’s official Xcode was not compromised, the problem is with the unofficial version of the tool uploaded to the cloud storage service of Baidu (Think China’s Google).
It’s a common practice in China to download necessary tools from third sites, and this time it turned out to be very bad habit.
There is a reason why Chinese developers choose unofficial and insecure sites instead of safe official resources.
Internet in the country is rather slow; moreover, Chinese government limits access to foreign servers to three gateways.
As installation package of Xcode tools size is about 3.59 GB, downloading it from Apple’s servers could take a decent amount of time.

So what actor behind the XcodeGhost needed to do was to infect an unofficial pack of tools with a smart and imperceptible malware and let legitimate developers do the job for them.
Researchers at Palo Alto Networks determined that malicious Xcode package had been available for six months and had been downloaded and used to build numerous new and updated iOS apps.
Then they were naturally pushed into the App Store and somehow bypassed Apple’s anti-malware scanning system.

Cancun, Mexico — Researchers from Kaspersky Lab have uncovered the first ever Arabic language advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
Dubbed Desert Falcons, the group of thirty or so attackers — some of whom are known by name — operates out of Palestine, Egypt and Turkey and is said to have developed and deployed their wares exclusively in the Middle East.
It is impossible to determine whether Desert Falcons is state sponsored.
Security Analyst Summit 2015 #theSAS2015
Their arsenal consists of homemade malware tools, social engineering and other techniques designed to execute and conceal campaigns on traditional and mobile operating systems.
Particularly, Desert Falcons’ malware is intended to steal sensitive information from its victims, which is then used to fuel further operations and even for extortion attempts against impacted targets.

The victims, according to Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, are targeted for secrets in their possession or intelligence information relating to their positions in governments or important organizations.
“More than 1 million files were stolen from victims,” the anti-malware company said.
“Stolen files include diplomatic communications from embassies, military plans and documents, financial documents, VIP and Media contact lists and files.”

The victims include military and government organizations, employees responsible for health organizations and combating money laundering, economic and financial institutions, leading media entities, research and educational institutions, energy and utilities providers, activists and political leaders, physical security companies, and other targets that have access to important geopolitical information.
Desert Falcons APT
Tools used in the Desert Falcons attack include backdoors into traditional computers through which the attackers install malware capable of logging keystrokes, taking screenshots and even remotely recording audio.
There is also a mobile component for Android with the capacity to spy in SMS text and call logs.
Interestingly, researchers presenting on Desert Falcons at Kaspersky Lab’s Security Analyst Summit said these are among the first to use Facebook chats in targeted attacks, connecting with targets via common Facebook pages until gaining their trust and sending them Trojan files via a chat hidden as a photo.
Desert Falcons APT
The group began building its tools as early as 2011 and achieved its first infections in 2013, but it wasn’t until the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015 that Desert Falcons’ activity really began to spike.
It seems that the group is more active now than it has been at any point in the past.
Kaspersky Lab says its products detect and block all variants of the malware used in this campaign.

Yesterday researchers said they discovered and disclosed to Apple, the vulnerability exploited by the WireLurker malware, which targeted iOS mobile devices via infections through USB connections to Mac OS X and Windows machines.
Masque-Attack-all-new-iOS-vulnerability_fb
The vulnerability is called “Masque” and it affects iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 8.1.1 beta.
Perhaps most interestingly, while initial reports suggested that the malware could only infect iOS user-devices via USB connection, researchers from FireEye yesterday said that the Masque bug is also exploitable by SMS text messages and email.
However, in order to infect via SMS or email, the attacker would have to compel a victim to follow a link leading to the malicious apps.
Researchers disclose a powerful #iOS vulnerability responsible for the #WireLurker #Apple #malware

Tweet
Technically, Masque gives attackers the ability to replace legitimate iOS apps with malicious ones without notification.
In part, the flaw relates to an iOS enterprise provisioning failure to double check the identity of a given app against its digital certificate when the developer does not upload the application to the App Store.
So in this case, iOS did not flag WireLurker’s certificates, which were legitimately signed – albeit using a different certificate – because the malware merely uploaded the application directly to the user’s phone from the infected desktop or laptop.
This is why, unlike earlier iOS malware, WireLurker had the capacity to infect non-jailbroken devices.

FireEye says that WireLurker is the only in the wild attack targeting the Masque vulnerability, but that it also appears to have been circulated among criminals.
The Masque bug remains unpatched.
To Apple’s credit, they moved fast to invalidate the certificates used by the malicious malware.
The need for anti-malware protection on Mac OS X devices cannot be overstated.
Shortly after the security firm Palo Alto Networks published their WireLurker findings last week, the group responsible for the malware shut their operation down.
However, when it was still up and running, it aimed to infect Windows and Mac machines, where it would lie dormant until the infected user attached an iPhone or iPod to his or her personal computer.
When and if that occurred, the malware then searched the connected iOS device for the presence of a few popular applications.
If present, WireLurker uninstalled those apps and replaced them with fake, trojanized replicas.
It is not clear what data the malware ultimately sought.

The only users that would have been impacted by WireLurker were users who had downloaded applications from a third-party application marketplace in China called Maiyadi.
Palo Alto researchers said, 467 infected OS X apps have been found on Maiyadi and those apps have been downloaded more than 350,000 times as of Oct. 16, by more than 100,000 users.
“The need for anti-malware protection on Mac OS X devices cannot be overstated,” explained Kaspersky’s global research and analysis team in a Securelist report.
“It’s not only that your Mac OS X machine can get infected, but WireLurker showed us how the infection can move from your Mac to your iPhone.
The good news is: there are plenty of options to chose from out there, including our own Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac.”

Many people still think that malware is a software that completely disrupts the normal functioning of PCs.
If your computer is working well, it means it’s not infected, right?
The main goal of cybercriminals is not to make a cyber-disaster just for kicks, but to earn money.
In many cases this goal dictates the complete opposite behavior of malware: the best one is the least visible to users.
Is your PC a part of Simda botnet?
For instance, such ‘stealth’ behavior is often typical for botnets.
Owners of these computers don’t have any idea that they are infected.
All they can see is that their PC works a bit slower, which is not unusual for PCs in general.
Botnets are designed to gather personal data including passwords, social security numbers, credit card details, addresses and telephone numbers.
This data may be used in crimes including identity theft, various types of fraud, spamming, and other malware distribution.

It always takes a lot of effort by many cooperating parties to shut down a large botnet.
A recent example is the Simda botnet, which is believed to have infected more than 770,000 computers in more than 190 countries.
Distribution of victims of Simda botnet by country
Simda is a ‘vending botnet’ used to distribute illicit software and different types of malware, including those capable of stealing financial credentials.
Creators of the specific malicious programs were simply paying the Simda owners a fee per each install.
In other words, this botnet was a kind of huge trade chain for malware ‘manufacturers’.
The botnet was active for years.
To make the malware more effective, Simda owners were working hard on new versions, generating and distributing them as frequently as every few hours.
At the moment, Kaspersky Lab’s virus collection contains more than 260,000 executable files belonging to different versions of the Simda malware.

A simultaneous take-down of 14 command and control servers of the Simda botnet located in the Netherlands, US, Luxembourg, Russia and Poland was carried out on Thursday, April 9th.
The list of organization involved in this shut down operation perfectly illustrates its complexity.
INTERPOL, Microsoft, Kaspersky Lab, Trend Micro, Cyber Defense Institute, FBI, Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), Police Grand-Ducale Section Nouvelles Technologies in Luxembourg, and Russian Ministry of the Interior’s Department ‘K’ were working together to counteract the cybercriminals.

“Botnets are geographically distributed networks and it is usually a challenging task to take down such a thing.
That’s why the collaborative effort of both private and public sectors is crucial here – every party makes its own important contribution to the joint project,” said Vitaly Kamluk, Principal Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab, and currently working closely with INTERPOL.
“In this case, Kaspersky Lab’s role was to provide technical analysis of the bot, collect botnet telemetry from the Kaspersky Security Network and advise on takedown strategies.”
As the investigation is still ongoing, it is too early to tell who is behind the Simda botnet.
What is important for users is that as a result of the disruption operation, command and control servers used by criminals to communicate with infected machines have been shut down.
Although the Simda botnet operation is suspended, people whose PCs were infected should get rid of this malware as soon as possible.

The Chinese-language Naikon advanced persistent threat group is targeting military, government and civil organizations located in and around the South China Sea, which is an increasingly contentious hot-bed of territorial disputes between various Southeast Asian nations.
Naikon is also known as APT-30.
Its targets, according to a new report from Kaspersky Lab’s global research and analysis team, are said to include the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, and Nepal.
Naikon APT expansion map
Like many APT campaigns, Naikon infects its victims with spear-phishing emails in which malicious executables masquerade as seemingly relevant document attachments.
When a victim opens one of these malicious attachments, a decoy document appears as an executable file and quietly exploits an old Microsoft Office vulnerability, installing malware on the victim’s machine.
For five years, the APT group has employed cultural liasons for each of its target countries.
In this way, Naikon is able to exploit cultural tendencies, such as the reliance on personal email addresses to conduct business.
Attackers exploited this reality by creating email addresses that appeared similar to those in actual use, which the attackers were able to leverage to send more effective phishing messages.

The group has also installed portions of its command and control infrastructure in the target countries in order to provide daily support for real-time connections and data theft.
They also have the capacity to intercept traffic across entire victim networks and issue some 48 distinct and remote commands, including taking a complete inventory of system files, downloading and uploading data, installing add-on modules, or working with the command line or prompt.
Taken together, these 48 commands allow the threat group to take complete control over any Naikon-infected machine.
Naikon’s ultimate goal is to gather geopolitical information.
The criminals behind the Naikon attacks managed to devise a very flexible infrastructure that can be set up in any target country
“The criminals behind the Naikon attacks managed to devise a very flexible infrastructure that can be set up in any target country, with information tunneling from victim systems to the command center,” explained Kaspersky Lab principle security researcher, Kurt Baumgartner.
“If the attackers then decide to hunt down another target in another country, they could simply set up a new connection.
Having dedicated operators focused on their own particular set of targets also makes things easy for the Naikon espionage group.”
In one country that Kaspersky Lab declined to name, the Naikon hackers managed to compromise Office of the President, Military Forces, Office of the Cabinet Secretary, National Security Council, Office of the Solicitor General, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency, Civil Aviation Authority, Department of Justice, Federal Police and Executive/Presidential Administration and Management Staff.

What is really worth mentioning is that this attack’s initial penetration method is based entirely on social engineering techniques.
And, unfortunately, it is quite a successful approach for many targeted attacks.
The attackers are offering an extremely funny video about office-working apes as bait.
The archive, including an executable video, is delivered via spear-phishing emails containing an attachment or a link to a website, sometimes a legitimate and even highly-rated site that has already been compromised.
How to mitigate CozyDuke / Office Monkey threat
While the video plays, the attack’s dropper is silently installed into the system, ready to receive commands and second stage malware components from the Command & Control servers.
The cybercriminals were not mistaken in thinking that many recipients would launch the video.
Not only have they launched it; they’ve shared it with office colleagues, thus actively assisting in the malware distribution process.
Given the high profile of the targets, the amount of sensitive information potentially stolen could be plentiful.
So the question is: how do you mitigate such a horrific threat, when even your own trusted employees are working against your carefully built security?
For sure, you shouldn’t underestimate the power of social engineering: how many loyal employees would, for example, resist opening a link in a (carefully forged) letter from their boss?
How to mitigate an Office Monkey threat

Actually, several very basic security precautions or Mitigation Strategies can work effectively against even the most sophisticated and thoroughly planned APTs.
For example, a simple curbing of administrative rights plus the timely patching of vulnerabilities and restricting the number of permitted apps can mitigate up to 85% of targeted attack-connected incidents.
Kaspersky lab’s Application Control with Dynamic Whitelisting would be a valuable asset here.
The Monkey video — as well as the other malware components of CozyDuke — would simply not be able to launch without being previously approved by a system administrator.

Some administrative staff may have a limited range of duties and responsibilities, while dealing on a day-to-day basis with highly sensitive correspondence.
Such a working scenario may be best addressed through adopting a Default Deny Applications Control mode, strictly limiting allowed executables to those system components and programs absolutely necessary to the individual’s work activities.
Other useful strategies, especially appropriate to government agencies or other highly regulated enterprises, may include:

Using Web Control technology to restrict access only to permitted web resources, limited to those that are work-related — or at least only to certain site categories.
Applying e-mail content filtering, as offered by Kaspersky Security for Exchange / Linux Mail, to rule out suspicious emails and attachments (such as archives), perhaps depending on the recipient’s role and seniority.
Using Device Control technology to avoid unsolicited transfers of information through the security perimeter to and from the outside world — or even within the perimeter.
As well as helping prevent the spread of malware, this approach can offer protection against some forms of intentional data theft.
Conducting specialized security training for employees, such as that offered by Kaspersky Lab as part of the Security Intelligence Services.
This will drive increased awareness and understanding of the dangers they face, even while they sit in their well-guarded offices.
It also educates them on how to avoid many seemingly innocent, yet unsafe practices that could cost their business a fortune — or even constitute a threat to their country’s security.

Take TeslaCrypt, for example.
It is a relatively new family of ransomware; its samples were first detected in February 2015.
The notable feature of the early TeslaCrypt versions was that malware was targeting not only usual sets of files, including documents, pictures and videos, but games-related file types as well.
By that time, it was a rather weak malware due to a couple of its technical flaws.
TeslaCrypt 2.0 ransomware
Despite the fact malware creators scared their victims with the frightful RSA-2048 algorithm, in reality the encryption was not that strong.
Moreover, during the encryption process the malware stored encryption keys in a file on the victim’s computer hard drive, making it possible to save the key by interrupting the encryptor’s operation, or to extract the key before the respective area of the disk was overwritten.
In the latest TeslaCrypt 2.0 version, which was recently discovered by Kaspersky Lab researchers, malware creators have implemented some new features preventing decryption of stolen files and discovery of malware’s command&control servers.

First, they’ve adopted the sophisticated elliptic curve encryption algorithm from creators of the famous and very troublesome CTB-Locker ransomware.
Secondly, they’ve changed the method of key storaging: now they are using the system registry instead of a file on disk.
Thirdly, TeslaCrypt creators have stolen the web page which victims see after their files have been encrypted from another ransomware family, CryptoWall.
Of course, all payment credentials are changed, but the rest of the text, which is very effective from a ‘selling’ point of view, is fully copied.
By the way, the ransom is rather large: about $500 at the current bitcoin exchange rate.
TeslaCrypt ransomware page
Malware from the TeslaCrypt family is known to be distributed using exploit kits such as Angler, Sweet Orange, and Nuclear.
This method of distributing malware works as follows: When a victim visits an infected website, an exploit’s malicious code uses vulnerabilities in the browser (usually in plugins) to install target malware in the system.

TeslaCrypt geography
Our recommendations on counteracting this and other families of ransomware include the following:

Create backup copies of all your important files on a regular basis.
Copies should be kept on media that are physically disconnected immediately after the backup copying is completed.
The last part is important, because the TeslaCrypt and other types of malware encrypt connected drives and network folders as well as the local hard drive.
It is crucially important to update your software in a timely fashion, especially the web browser and its plugins.
In case a malicious program lands on your system, it will be best addressed by the latest version of a security software with updated databases and activated security modules.

The up-to-date Windows 8.1 comes with a built-in firewall and a type of anti-virus protection delivered via Defender.
Browser developers continue to think about security as well: for example, Chrome tries to detect suspicious sites and warn you before opening them, and it’s sandboxing system is supposed to prevent malware from going out from one tab and infecting all the others.
The continual evolution of mobile malware
Of course, these levels of protection aren’t perfect and in many cases they frequently fail.
That’s why people install complex security solutions and let those solutions protect them.
The problem is that smartphones and tablets do not look like PCs — and maybe that’s why only a few treat their security seriously.
Actually, your smartphone is a computer – a rather powerful one for that matter.
It is connected to your financial accounts and in addition it’s almost certainly poorly protected.
In 2015 the number of mobile Trojans of all stripes dramatically increased.
Throughout the year our solutions detected and stopped 2,961,727 malicious installation packages.

In other words, we prevented Trojans from infecting mobile devices for almost 3 million times.
That’s a lot, and those are the stats for malware detected by Kaspersky Lab alone.
Just imagine how big these figures would be for the whole world!
What’s worse, we expect this trend to continue and to grow — even more mobile devices will be at risk in the year 2016.
Fake mobile banks steal money

In 2015 we detected 7,030 new mobile banking Trojans.
This kind of malware is getting quite smart and learning new hurtful tricks.
For example, certain Trojans are capable of overlaying the on-screen display of a legitimate banking app with a fake copy, created for phishing purposes.
The victim sees a familiar interface, enters the credit card data and stays with card balance reset to 0.
OpFake is one of the most notable examples of such programs as it can imitate the interface of more than 100 legitimate banking and financial apps.
The Acecard family is also quite qualified: it can spoof at least 30 banking apps as well as overlay any app following the C&C server commands.

Sometimes Trojans come together with official apps from your bank.
For example, the SmsThief malware, detected in Q2 2015, was embedded in a legitimate banking app.
This was done without affecting its operation, making this malware more difficult to detect.
As it’s clear from its name, this Trojan steals victim’s’ messages and sends them to the attackers together with other information like the device model and some personal data.
Another approach utilized by criminals is to target a broader circle of apps, not just the Internet banking applications.
For example, FakeInst Trojan displays a message, presumably from Google, demanding that the user opens Google Wallet and goes through an ‘identification’ procedure, which involves entering credit card details.
The reasons can be quite different including even the need to combat cybercrime.
This window cannot be removed until the victim enters the credit card details and… you know what comes next.
Mobile Ransomware to blackmail

The amount of Trojan-Ransom families doubled in 2015 compared to the previous year, while the number of detected modifications increased 3.5 times.
Moreover, in 2015 the amount of victims increased fivefold.
It looks like those cybercriminals who were already creating Ransomware continued to do so, and their profit lures new players to the market.

When one of these Trojans blocks a device, the user is often accused of committing some alleged misdemeanor, like failing to protect their devices.
They also have to pay to unblock their gadget – the ransom ranging from $12 to $100.
In such a way your child photos or sweetheart’s selfies can cost you a dinner or a fashion item, and bring millions to criminals, who gather money from hundreds and thousands of victims.
Mobile ransomware is likely to continue evolving in 2016.
The popularity of these programs among attackers is growing and this leads to future expansion.
SMS Trojans subscribe people to unnecessary services

This type of malware remains a serious threat, though its share in the overall flow of mobile threats is gradually declining.
In case you don’t know, these programs send paid text messages from an infected device or subscribe the victims to paid services.
Of course, the users stay unaware of what is going on and why the money is written off their accounts.

Despite all Google’s efforts to protect it, malware is found upside down and sideways its Play Store.
Moreover, last year the Apple’s secure garden was also compromised, all thanks to a smart deceit — no advance technology was needed.
As a result, dozens of applications were infected, including very popular ones.

Security experts often mention exploits as one of the most serious problems with data and systems safety; although it’s not always clear what the difference is between exploits and the malware in general.
Exploits are a subset of malware.
These malicious programs contain data or executable code, which is able to take advantage of one or more vulnerabilities in the software running on a local or remote computer.
Put Simply: You have a browser and there is a vulnerability in it that allow “an arbitrary code” to run (i.e. install and launch some malicious program) on your system without your knowledge.
Most often the first step for the attackers is allowing privilege escalation, so they can do anything within the attacked system.

Browsers, along with Flash, Java, and Microsoft Office, are among the most targeted software categories.
Being ubiquitous, they are actively explored by security experts and hackers alike, and developers regularly have to release patches to fix vulnerabilities.
It’s best if these patches are applied at once, but unfortunately that is not always the case.
For instance, you should close all browser tabs or documents to perform an update.
Another problem is exploits for the yet unknown vulnerabilities, discovered and abused by blackhats: so-called zero-days or 0days.
It may take a while before the vendors know they have a problem and work it over.
Infection routes

Cybercriminals often prefer exploits over other infection methods like social engineering – which can be hit or miss – the use of vulnerabilities continues to produce the desired results.
First, by visiting a site that contains malicious exploit code.
Second, by opening a seemingly legitimate file with hidden malicious code.
As one may easily guess, it’s most likely spam or a phishing email that will bring the exploit in.

As noted in Securelist, exploits are designed to strike specific versions of software that contain vulnerabilities.
If the user has that version of the software to open the malicious object, or if a website is using that software to operate, the exploit is triggered.
Once it gains access through the vulnerability, the exploit then loads additional malware from the criminals’ server which performs malicious activity such as stealing personal data, using the computer as part of a botnet to distribute spam or carry out DDoS attacks, or whatever the culprits behind it intend to do.
Exploits pose a threat even for the aware and diligent users who keep their software updated.
The reason is a time gap between the discovery of vulnerability and a release of the patch to fix it.
During that time, exploits are able to function freely and threaten the security of nearly all Internet users – unless there are automatic tools to prevent exploit attacks installed.
And don’t forget about above mentioned ‘open tabs syndrome’: there’s a price to be paid for update, and not every user is ready to pay it right away when a patch is available.
Exploits run in packs

Exploits are often packed together so that an attacked system is checked against a wide range of vulnerabilities; once one or more are detected, the appropriate exploits enter.
Exploit kits also widely use code obfuscation to avoid detection and encrypt URL paths to prevent researchers from unrooting them.
Among the best known are:

Angler – one of the most sophisticated kits on the underground market.
This one changed the game after it had begun detecting antivirus and virtual machines (often used by security researchers as honeypots), and deploying encrypted dropper files.
It is one of the fastest kits to incorporate newly released zero-days and its malware runs from memory, without having to write to the hard drives of its victims.
Technical description of the pack is available here.

Conclusion

Exploits are not always detectable by security software.
To successfully detect exploit the security software should employ behavior analysis – it’s the only good way to beat exploits.
Malware programs may be plentiful and varied, but most of them have similar behavioral patterns.

Kaspersky Internet Security, as well as other Kaspersky Lab’s flagship products employ a technology which is called Automatic Exploit Prevention and uses the information about the most typical behavior of the known exploits.
The characteristic behaviour of such malicious programs helps to prevent infection even in the case of a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability exploit.

Analysts and researchers agree that 2016 is the year when ransomware went really big.
Cybercrooks didn’t need much time to see the potential value of cryptolockers, and they readily added ransomware to their arsenals.
To give you an idea of the profitability, Cisco researchers reported in 2015 that a single Angler exploit kit brings cybercriminals profits of up to $60 million annually, or on average $5 million every month!
ZCryptor: Ransomware that spreads itself as a worm
The usual suspects of the modern ransomware market — Petya and his friend Mischa, as well as their distant relative, Locky — currently prey on users in more than 100 countries.
Hackers recently started focusing more attention on enterprises and organizations in possession of valuable data: Lately, a number of US hospitals became victims of ransomware attacks.
The rise of cryptoworms

In their attempts to get as much money as possible, as soon as possible, cybercriminals seek ways to expand their attacks so they can further propagate their lockers.
Malicious spam campaigns still work, but they are not as efficient as before; with cyberthreats getting coverage in the media, users are becoming more savvy and getting to know the most frequently used tricks.
In another important development, Web browsers and antiviruses have learned to detect and block malicious URLs or malware-laced spam.
In response, hackers have gradually phased out their usual “carpet bombing” approach to malware distribution.

Researchers predict that the next stage of ransomware development will bring cryptoworms — a poisonous hybrid of self-propagating malware and ransomware.
This new type of malware takes the best of both worlds to form a new species of ransomware that can copy and distribute itself by means of infected computers, efficiently encrypting files and demanding ransom.
The first such malware was SamSam, which sneaked onto a number of enterprise networks and infected computers on the networks as well as cloud storage containing backup copies.
ZCryptor

This week, Microsoft detected a new sample of a cryptoworm, dubbed ZCryptor.
It’s unique in that it both encrypts files and self-propagates to other computers and network devices without using malicious spam or an exploit kit.
To infect the first victim, ZCryptor uses common techniques, masquerading as an installer of a popular program (e.g., Adobe Flash) or infiltrating the system through malicious macros in a Microsoft Office file.

Once inside the system, the cryptoworm infects external drives and flash drives so it can be distributed to other computers, and then starts to encrypt files.
ZCryptor can encrypt more than 80 file formats (some sources say 120 formats) by adding a .
zcrypt extension to the name of the file.
After that, the story revolves around a well-known scenario: Users see an HTML page informing them that their files are encrypted and available for a ransom — in this case, 1.2 bitcoins (about $650).
If the users don’t pay that sum in four days, the ransom increases to 5 bitcoins (more than $2,500).
Unfortunately, experts have not been able to find way to decrypt the files and let the affected users bypass the ransom option.
That means the only reasonable option for now is to be extra cautious and avoid infection.

Means of protection

If you want to be spared a ZCryptor attack, use these simple tips:

Update your operating system and software regularly, closing exploitable vulnerabilities and thus preventing the cryptoworm from travelling around your network.
Always be on alert and avoid suspicious websites; don’t open attachments coming from a murky source.
In general, respect the basic rules of digital hygiene.
Disable macros in Microsoft Word — they are regaining popularity among cybercrooks as a means of dropping malware.
Regularly back up your files and store one copy on an external drive that you then disconnect from your PC.
Although backed-up files do not prevent ransomware from infecting your system they are solid protection: If you have your valuable data at hand, there’s no reason to pay ransom.
Of course, use reliable protection software.

cryptor malware Ransomware self-propagating trojan worm ZCryptor
A new Android Trojan uses a victims’ devices to infect WiFi routers and funnel any users of the network to malicious sites.
The malware doesn’t target users directly – instead its goal is to facilitate further attacks by turning victims into accomplices.
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who discovered the malware and dubbed it Switcher Trojan, claim they’ve seen two versions of the malware.
Attackers have used both iterations to commandeer 1,280 wireless networks, most of them in China, according to Nikita Buchka, a mobile security expert with the firm.
One version of the malware mimics a mobile client for the Chinese search engine Baidu.
Another passes itself off as a version of an app used for locating and sharing WiFi login information.
Once a victim has downloaded one of the versions, it gets to work attacking the router.
The malware does so by carrying out a brute-force password guessing attack on the router’s admin web interface.
Once in, Switcher swaps out the addresses of the router’s DNS servers for a rogue server controlled by the attackers along with a second DNS, in case the rogue one goes down.
This makes it so queries from devices on the network are re-routed to the servers of the attacker, something that can open victims to redirection, phishing, malware and adware attacks.
“The ability of the Switcher Trojan to hijack [DNS] gives the attackers almost complete control over network activity which uses the name-resolving system, such as internet traffic,” Kaspersky Lab said Wednesday, “The approach works because wireless routers generally reconfigure the DNS settings of all devices on the network to their own – thereby forcing everyone to use the same rogue DNS.”
The creators of the Trojan were a little sloppy when it came to crafting parts of its command and control website however; they left a table complete with internal infection statistics publicly viewable.
According to Buchka, who has reviewed the site, the attackers boast to have infiltrated 1,280 WiFi networks over the last several weeks.
In a Securelist post on the malware posted Wednesday Buchka cautioned users to review their routers’ DNS settings for the following rogue servers: 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11, and 120.76.249.59.
He also took the opportunity to encourage users – although for many it goes without saying – to verify that they’ve changed their routers’ default login and passwords.
Several weeks ago a handful of router users in Germany fell victim when a variant of Mirai, the nasty malware that’s become synonymous with internet of things vulnerabilities, took hold of their devices.
While those routers didn’t suffer from a hardcoded username/password vulnerability, they did have port 7547, usually used by internet service providers to remotely manage the device, open.
The behavior of Switcher is somewhat similar to that of DNSChanger, malware that’s been repurposed as an exploit kit as of late.
A recent campaign observed by Proofpoint was targeting wireless routers and changing DNS entries in order to steal traffic.
In that instance routers made by D-Link, Netgear, Pirelli and Comtrend were vulnerable.
According to Buchka, the hardcoded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the Switcher Trojan tries to access suggests it may work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers.
Criminals are breathing new life into Cerber ransomware with a stubborn spam campaign called Blank Slate that is successfully abusing hosting providers to spread the malware.
Researchers at the SANS Internet Storm Center said the campaign has shifted from spreading Sage 2.0 and Locky ransomware, to in recent weeks attempting to infect Windows PCs with Cerber ransomware.

Sage and Satan Ransomware, Double Trouble
January 23, 2017 , 11:00 am
Identified last July, Blank Slate has effectively survived several shutdown attempts by hosting providers with a slick process for registering new servers that host the ransomware executable, said Brad Duncan, handler at the SANS Internet Storm Center and threat intelligence analyst at Unit 42 of Palo Alto Networks, in blog post.
The Blank Slate campaign gets its name from the fact its spam messages contain no text in the subject or body of the message.
Emails contain only a double-zip archive with the second zip archive containing either a malicious JavaScript file or a malicious Microsoft Word document.
The blank message and double-zip archive may seem crude, but Duncan believes crooks are under the belief it is an effective way to evade detection technologies.
The infection chain is conventional starting with the  double-zip archive.
If the JavaScript is double-clicked, or the Word macro is enabled, Cerber is downloaded from a server and ultimately infects the host.
Notable, researchers said, is that criminals behind Cerber have recently upped their ransomware demand from $500 to 1 bitcoin ($1,000).
For its part, Cerber has been a potent strain of ransomware morphing over the past year to remain a consistent threat.
Last week, researchers at Deep Instinct said the latest sample of Cerber it examined was finding great success bypassing security detection systems with a new technique where malicious code was buried inside NSIS installers.
What is most interesting about the Blank Slate campaign is how it eludes shutdown attempts by hosting providers, according to the SANS report.
“These malicious domains were quickly taken offline, but Blank Slate actors quickly registered new ones, revealing a cycle of abuse towards legitimate hosting providers,” Duncan said.
“The requirements for establishing an account at a hosting provider are easy to obtain.
The criminals only require a valid email, phone number, and credit card.
Criminals can establish new servers; those servers are reported; the hosting provider shuts them down; and the criminals establish new servers,” Duncan said in an interview with Threatpost.
Costs to perpetuate the cycle of abuse are negligible for crooks.
“A new email account can be established for free.
Burner phones are cheap, as low as $20,” Duncan wrote.
Stolen credit card credentials can be purchased on the black market for $5.
Unit 42 believes the campaign of blank messages is coming from numerous hosts around the globe from what it believes are botnets.
An examination of the JavaScript file revealed an HTTP GET request for the ransomware binary.
“Post-infection traffic was similar to several other recent examples of Cerber.
You’ll see UDP traffic from the infected host over port 6892.
That’s followed by HTTP traffic to a domain starting with p27dokhpz2n7nvgr and ending with .
top.
IP addresses for the UDP traffic changes every week or two (or longer).
Post-infection HTTP domains change more frequently,” Duncan wrote.
He said decryption instructions were dropped to the desktop in three different files.
File names began with “_READ_THIS_FILE_” and consisted of a text file, an image file and an HTML Application (HTA) file.
“Domains and IP addresses associated with the Blank Slate campaign are constantly changing,” Duncan wrote.
“With the current popularity of ransomware, we continue to see malspam daily in both targeted attacks and wide-scale distribution.”
After almost a four-year respite, the data-stealing TeamSpy malware has resurfaced, or at least that’s what a spam campaign detected over the weekend suggests, researchers say.
Researchers at the CrySyS Lab in Hungary originally identified the malware back in March 2013 when they traced it back to a years-long espionage campaign.
At the time researchers surmised the attack, which was focused on high profile industrial, research, or diplomatic targets, may have been ongoing for up to 10 years.

Fileless Malware Campaigns Tied to Same Attacker
March 16, 2017 , 2:00 pm
Researchers from Danish firm Heimdal Security said on Monday they observed a new campaign launched over the weekend spreading the malware.
The campaign relies heavily on spamming victims and tricking them into opening a rigged .
zip file that’s disguised as an e-fax file.
zip file is opened, an .
exe file that’s nested inside is activated and code – in the form of a malicious DLL (MSIMG32.dll) – is dropped onto the victim’s machine.
The malware uses DLL hijacking to write system usernames and passwords to a text file, “Log%s#%.3u.txt,” and send them along to the attacker’s command-and-control server.
The malware is interested in more than just credentials, Andra Zaharia, a security evangelist with the firm, told Threatpost Thursday.
“The malware is not only capable of stealing credentials, but can also take screenshots, gather information about the computer’s operating system, details about the security products installed on it and more,” Zaharia said.
The malware, like incidents unearthed in 2013, includes components from the legitimate application TeamViewer, a remote support tool.
While attackers previously blended TeamViewer components with malware modules, the most recent strain of attacks combines TeamViewer’s entire software.
According to Zaharia, a TeamViewer executable is among some of the files dropped into the victim’s %SystemDrive% file.
DLLs like TeamViewer_Resource_en.dll and TeamViewer_StaticRes.dll, as well as a VPN tool, and keylogger are also dropped.
Zaharia says the attack uses TeamViewer to thwart detection.
By starting a TeamViewer session attackers can access encrypted content and sidestep two-factor authentication.
All of this is done without the victim’s knowledge; the TeamViewer session makes the attackers practically invisible.
The firm says the campaign appears to be “highly related” to a series of spear phishing campaigns against Hungary.
Those attacks employed LatentBOT, a strain of malware uncovered by researchers at FireEye in 2015 that’s lingered in the wild since 2013.
The malware, while not present in the TeamSpy campaign, utilizes several layers of obfuscation, features what researchers call a unique exfiltration mechanism, and is known for being skilled at monitoring victims without being detected.
It’s unclear if this campaign is in anyway related to previously uncovered TeamSpy campaigns, but it wouldn’t be far fetched if the same group were involved.
CrySyS researchers said in 2013 there was a clear connection between samples it observed and that it was likely that one group was responsible for a series of campaigns it observed over a 10 year span targeting victims in the US, Canada, China and Brazil.
“The attackers use distinct tools for nearly every simple activity – this means that most likely the group is small and technically professional people carry out all types of activities, including strategic planning and executing the attacks,” CrySyS researchers said of the attacks at the time.
When reached on Tuesday a spokesperson for TeamViewer said the company was investigating Heimdal’s report but that it has no reason to assume a vulnerability in the software is in play.
“This is obviously a post-exploit action, so the real issue is the preceding malware infection,” TeamViewer said in a statement, adding that nonetheless users should still ensure they keep their software updated, avoid affiliate or bundles, and only download TeamViewer through official channels.
This article was updated on Friday, February 28 to include additional information from Heimdal Security.
The Dridex banking Trojan has been updated and now sports a new injection method for evading detection based on the technique known as AtomBombing.
Researchers with IBM X-Force identified the new Dridex v4 sample earlier this month and said it is already in use in active campaigns against U.K. banks.
They said it’s only a matter of time before cybercrime gangs begin targeting U.S. financial institutions.

Dridex Returns With Windows UAC Bypass Method
January 27, 2017 , 1:56 pm
“Over the long reign of Dridex v3, we have seen some significant changes implemented into the malware’s operations, such as modified anti-research techniques, redirection attacks and fraudulent M.O. changes.
It is not surprising to see a new major version released from this gang’s developers,” according to an X-Force report on Dridex v4 released Tuesday.
As with previous campaigns, Dridex exhibits typical behavior of monitoring a victim’s traffic to bank sites and stealing login and account information.
The biggest change is tied to Dridex v4’s code injection method.
Code injection, researchers point out, is one of the most closely monitored processes by antivirus and other security solutions.
Current injection techniques by previous versions of Dridex have become too common and easy to spot, they said.
That’s forced cyber gangs to leverage AtomBombing in a new version of Dridex.
AtomBombing is a different approach to code injection that doesn’t rely on easy-to-spot API calls used by previous versions of Dridex.
The AtomBombing technique, first spotted in October 2016 by enSilo researchers, allows Dridex v4 to inject code sans the aforementioned API calls.
“AtomBombing makes use of Windows’ atom tables and the native API NtQueueApcThread to copy a payload into a read-write memory space in the target process,” according to the report authors.
“It then uses NtSetContextThread to invoke a simple return-oriented programming chain that allocates read/write/execute memory, copies the payload into it and executes it.
Finally, it restores the original context of the hijacked thread.”
Atom tables are a function of the Windows operating system that allows applications to store and access temporary data and to share data between applications.
An attacker can write malicious code into an atom table and force a legitimate program to retrieve it from the table, researchers describe.
What makes Dridex v4 different from other AtomBombing attacks is that attackers only use “the technique for writing the payload, then used a different method to achieve execution permissions, and for the execution itself,” according to co-authors of the X-Force report Magal Baz and Or Safran.
Where Dridex v4 differs is at the tail end of the AtomBombing technique where “Dridex simply calls NtProtectVirtualMemory from the injecting process to change the memory where the payload is already written into the read/write/execute (memory).”
That cues up Dridex to use the Windows asynchronous procedure to call GlobalGetAtomA, which executes the payload, X-Force said.
“The last stage is the execution of the payload.
To avoid calling CreateRemoteThread, Dridex again uses APC.
Using an APC call to the payload itself would be very suspicious,” said researchers.
Alternatively, Dridex v4 uses “the same GlobalGetAtomW method to patch GlobalGetAtomA, hooking it to execute the payload.”
X-Force said this specific implementation of AtomBombing is a first of its kind in the context of banking Trojans and designed to cloak the malware’s activities.
Other enhancements to Dridex v4 include a modified naming algorithm, enhanced encryption for its configuration and an updated persistence mechanism.
“The changes to Dridex’s code injection method are among the most significant enhancements in v4,” wrote researchers.
“The adoption of a new injection technique shortly after its discovery demonstrates Dridex’s efforts to keep up with the times and the evolution of security controls.”
While campaigns have fluctuated in volume, innovation into the malware has been consistent.
In January, researchers at Flashpoint said they spotted a new variant of the Dridex Trojan with a technique that can bypass Windows User Account Control (UAC).
In 2015, an older version of Dridex started using an evasion detection technique called AutoClose that involved phishing messages that contained macros-based attacks that did not execute until the malicious document was closed.
The Necurs botnet has learned a new trick.
Instead of spewing spam delivering Locky ransomware, the notorious botnet is now capable of launching DDoS attacks.
According to BitSight’s Anubis Labs, the malware was modified in September to include a module that adds DDoS capabilities and new proxy command-and-control communication functions.
Necurs is the malware that makes up the botnet that goes by the same name and is currently active on one million Windows PCs, according to researcher Tiago Pereira, threat intel researcher with Anubis Labs.

Locky Limps Back into Action After Lull
January 19, 2017 , 2:07 pm
Threatpost News Wrap, January 6, 2017
January 6, 2017 , 12:00 pm
“Necurs is a modular malware that can be used for many different purposes.
What’s new with the sample we found is the addition of a module that adds SOCKS/HTTP proxy and DDoS capabilities to this malware,” he said.
About six months ago, Pereira said, Anubis Labs noticed that beside the usual port 80 communications, a Necurs-infected system was communicating with a set of IPs through a different port using, what appeared to be, a different protocol.
When Anubis Labs researchers reverse engineered the sample of the Necurs malware, they noticed what appeared to be a simple SOCKS/HTTP proxy module for communications between it and the command-and-control server.
“As we looked at the commands the bot would accept from the C2, we realized that there was an additional command, that would cause the bot to start making HTTP or UDP requests to an arbitrary target in an endless loop, in a way that could only be explained as a DDoS attack,” Pereira described in a research blog posted Friday.
Researchers are careful to point out the DDoS function has not been utilized by those behind the Necurs botnet at this time.
Botnet owners use the compromised bots as proxies (HTTP, SOCKSv4 and SOCKSv5 protocols), relaying connections through them in two modes of operation (direct proxy and proxy backconnect), according to the report.
“There are also three types of messages (or commands) sent by the C2 to the bot, that can be distinguished,” Pereira said.
Breaking it down even further, the Start DDoS attack command includes two possible modes: HTTPFlood and UDPFlood.
The Necurs bot will start an HTTP flood attack against the target if the first bytes of the message payload are the string “http:/”.
If the first bytes of the message payload are not the string “http:/”, the bot will start an UDP flood attack against the target.
“Given the size of the Necurs botnets (more than one million IP/24 hours in the largest botnet), even the most basic techniques should produce a very powerful attack,” Pereira wrote.
“The HTTP attack works by starting 16 threads that perform an endless loop of HTTP requests… The UDP flood attack works by repeatedly sending a random payload with size between 128 and 1024 bytes,” according to the report.
The remote access Trojan NetWire is back and this time making the rounds pilfering payment card data.
The move is a shift for attackers behind notorious NetWire, that was once thought to be the first multi-platform RAT.
Over the last couple of years payment card breaches have been mostly synonymous with point of sale (POS) malware that scrapes memory from credit and debit cards swiped through the infected system.
A new variant of NetWire RAT scrapes card data and also boasts an integrated keylogger that can sniff data from devices like USB card readers, according to researchers at SecureWorks, who detailed on Monday the latest version of the RAT they came across back in September.
The RAT relies on victims opening an attachment in a phishing email; once opened the malware is downloaded and the infection can linger for months or years until it’s discovered, according to SecureWorks researchers.
Researchers claim they spotted the RAT collecting data during an incident response engagement, but that this particular variant wasn’t specially trained to target POS systems.
This iteration was a .
EXE file and gets to work maintaining persistence.
Researchers claim the file creates a Windows shortcut in the Startup menu, something that ensures the RAT launches every time the victim logs into the system.
Researchers note the file has nothing to do with TeamViewer; it was likely just the name the malware’s author gave it to trick victims into thinking the file was the actual remote support software.
In addition to copying itself to the startup menu, NetWire also injects code in notepad.exe to evade detection.
Ironically, the technique did more harm than good and got the malware noticed, as it’s odd for notepad to have an active network connection.
It wasn’t until researchers devised a decoder to decode the keylogger’s output files that they determined it was actually stealing sensitive information.
They found track one and track two card data, plain text credentials and data that helps the attacker know where the data was entered.
“The files also display the window title of the opened application, which reveals which application and website the sensitive information was entered,” SecureWorks’ research describes.
Researchers with the firm didn’t disclose which company’s system it discovered the RAT on, only that it was an organization that processes numerous credit cards on a daily basis.
The NetWire RAT is by no means new – it’s been around in one iteration or another since 2012.
Attackers used NetWire last year in a rash of attacks against banks and healthcare companies.
Victims of that variant would have had to have opened a malicious Word document, rigged with macros, to download the RAT from Dropbox in order to get infected.
In 2014 researchers with Palo Alto Networks discovered that a group of Nigerian scammers – operating under the guise of Silver Spaniel – were using Netwire to remotely control infected systems.
Researchers with FireEye observed a separate spam campaign that same year peddling RATs like Netwire and DarkComet, along with Trojans such as Zeus and Handsnake.
Retail chains are likely wary to hear of this week’s Netwire news.
The holiday season is perpetually marred by credit card fraud.
Three years ago the now infamous Target hack affected customers who shopped at U.S. Target stores during this pivotal span of time, between November 27 and December 15.
The same malware that hit Target’s point of sale terminals, BlackPOS, was ultimately tied to the even bigger hack of Home Depot that following summer, although that connection was disputed by some experts.
Researchers have observed an uptick in attacks using the banking malware Floki Bot against U.S., Canadian and Brazilian banks, and insurance firms.
Floki Bot, which uses code from the once notorious Zeus banking Trojan, has evolved and unlike its predecessor, is targeting point-of-sale systems via aggressive spear phishing campaigns and the RIG exploit kit.

Flash Exploit Found in Seven Exploit Kits
December 6, 2016 , 1:58 pm
Cisco Talos and Flashpoint security researchers coordinated the release of reports on Floki Bot on Wednesday.
Both firms warn the malware is quickly gaining popularity within Dark Web criminal forums.
“Floki Bot is currently being actively bought and sold on several darknet markets,” wrote Cisco Talos in its report released Wednesday.
“It will likely continue to be seen in the wild as cybercriminals continue to attempt to leverage it to attack systems in an aim to monetize their efforts.”
This most recent version of Floki Bot, spotted in September, is based on the Zeus 2.0.8.9 source code released in 2011.
There have been several incarnations of Floki Bot since then, however this most recent version is being developed, marketed and sold by a shrewd hacker that goes by the same name as the malware.
“This actor is remarkable for a number of reasons, in particular their presence in a number of top-tier underground communities across a range of languages (Portuguese, English and Russian),” wrote Vitali Kremez, senior intelligence analyst at Flashpoint in a report also released Wednesday.
Kremez believes Flokibot’s native language is Portuguese and that the hacker is based in Brazil.
Typical infections stem from spear phishing attacks where victims are enticed to enable malicious macros in Microsoft Word documents sent as email attachments.
Once enabled, the macro retrieves the Floki Bot malware, according to Kremez.
“Once the malware is executed, it attempts to inject malicious code into ‘explorer.exe’ – the Microsoft Windows file manager,” according to Talos’ technical analysis of the inject sequence of the Floki Bot malware code.
“If it is unable to open ‘explorer.exe’, it will then inject into ‘svchost.exe’.”
The injection is a PE file (bot32).
“The sample we analyzed is hardcoded to only pass the address of the ‘bot32’ resource to the injected payload,” Cisco Talos wrote.
“At every stage, the malware uses hashing to obfuscate module and function names used in dynamic library resolution.”
According to Flashpoint researchers Floki Bot differs significantly from the Zeus that was distributed in mass spam campaigns.
Zeus also did not include PoS scraping functionality and was absent of any antivirus obfuscation techniques discovered in Floki Bot in November.
“While the malware originates from the well-known Zeus 2.0.8.9 source code, Floki Bot adds a hooking method to grab track data from memory thereby extending the malware operations beyond regular banking Trojan functionality, making it more potent and versatile,” Kremez wrote.
Other distinctions between Floki Bot and Zeus include Floki Bot availability on the Dark Web selling for $1,000.
The Zeus variant called GameOver, on the other hand, was only distributed to a close circle of criminal gangs and sold for $15,000 in its prime, Kremez said.
“GameOver Zeus, in its heyday, was used by only five exclusive gangs.”
In 2007, Zeus malware earned notoriety for compromising nearly 75,000 websites owned by the likes of ABC, Bank of America and Oracle.
In 2013, the Zeus code was used to construct Citadel malware, known for its cunning ability to steal personal, banking and financial information.
Denmark-based Heimdal Security reported in April that Zeus code had been re-purposed to create the variant Atmos malware, which went on to target banks in France.
Atmos can either scrape data from its target computer or simply hide out and collect user credentials.
Another interesting distinction between ZeuS and Floki Bot is the presence of Tor network support in the source code.
Talos says the Tor support code is non-functional and “appears to be under development and could not be activated in the samples.”
Both Cisco and Flashpoint warn that those behind Floki Bot have worked hard to lower the technical bar needed for cyber criminals to use the tool.
“The time required to attain a high level of skill and sophistication has been continuously reduced.
As criminals share information to defeat protections, we should be sharing it as well with our community to defeat threats,” Flashpoint wrote.
CERBER is a ransomware family that has seen its share of unusual features since its appearance early last year.
From its use of audio warnings, to the targeting of cloud platforms and databases, to distribution via malvertising, emailed scripting files, and exploit kits, CERBER has always been willing to keep up with the times, as it was.
One reason for its apparent popularity may be the fact that it is sold in the Russian underground, giving a wide variety of cybercriminals access to it.
However, we’ve started seeing CERBER variants (which we detect as RANSOM_CERBER.
F117AK) add a new wrinkle to their behavior: they have gone out of their way to avoid encrypting security software.
Normally, ransomware’s goal is to encrypt the data on a system and leave the applications intact.
Files in folders where applications are typically installed and where the operating system is located are usually whitelisted by ransomware and not encrypted.
The new CERBER variants go above and beyond this by checking if any security products are installed on the system.
The built-in Windows Management Interface (WMI) is “the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems”.
In effect, it is a powerful tool used for (as the name implies) sharing system management information.
This frequently includes software, including security products.
CERBER queries for the contents of three WMI classes: FirewallProduct, AntiVirusProduct, and AntiSpywareProduct.
As the name implies, these are for firewalls, antivirus, and antispyware products.
CERBER extracts the directories where these are installed and adds them to the list of whitelisted folders, which are spared from any encryption.
Code for detecting security products

It’s not clear what the immediate goal of this behavior is.
The typical directories for software installation of any kind in Windows are typically already part of the whitelist.
exe or .
dll extensions are not targeted for encryption either.
For now, it appears that the attackers only want to be triply sure that security software is not encrypted.
Aside from this security software detection, the behavior of these variants is similar to other CERBER variants, with a ransom demand of 1 BTC (approximately US$1,000), which doubles in price to 2 BTC after five days).
The infection vectors are also similar.

Last April 2015, we talked about FighterPOS, a point-of-sale (PoS) malware that was used in a one-man cybercriminal operation to steal over 22,000 unique credit card numbers and affected more than 100 PoS terminals in Brazil and other countries.
We recently came across new and seemingly improved versions of this malware.
Among other things, FighterPOS now has propagation capabilities; meaning, it could spread from one PoS malware terminal to another that is connected to the same network and thereby increasing the number of potential victims in one organization.
It is also interesting to note that based on the analysis of their code, the new FighterPOS samples have strings of code written in English, instead of Portuguese.
Data gathered from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network supports these findings: while more than 90% of connection attempts to FighterPOS command-and-control (C&C) servers are still located in Brazil, the number of affected systems in the US is at 6%.
The new version (top) uses the word “command” in its code, instead of the Portuguese “comando” in the original FighterPOS version (bottom)

 



Figure 2.
Connection attempts of new FIghterPOS variants to C&C servers from Jan. 23 – Feb. 16

 

We analyzed two of the recent samples we’ve seen: “Floki Intruder” (detected as WORM_POSFIGHT.
SMFLK), which is capable of spreading copies of itself, and a lightweight version detected as TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F.

Floki Intruder

While Floki Intruder resembles the original FighterPOS in that it is based on the same vnLoader botnet client, it appears that it was compiled on a separate machine, most likely by the threat actor that added the new capabilities.
Among the capabilities Floki Intruder shares with FighterPOS include disabling Windows firewall and default Windows protection and disabling the User Account Control.
It is also capable of detecting any security product through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
Both FighterPOS and Floki Intruder are also distributed through compromised websites, and their updates are downloaded from their command-and-control (C&C) servers.
Perhaps the most notable update Floki Intruder has from FighterPOS is that it is able to enumerate logical drives to drop copies of itself and an autorun.inf by using WMI.
Adding this routine, in a way, makes sense: given that it is quite common for PoS terminals to be connected in one network, a propagation routine will not only enable the attacker to infect as many terminals as possible with the least amount of effort, it will also make this threat more difficult to remove because reinfection will occur as long as at least one terminal is affected.
Autorun.inf automatically executes InstallExplorer.exe when the logical drive is accessed.
TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F

Unlike the original FighterPOS, TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F is not derived from vnLoader, thus the C&C communication is different.
Because of its smaller size, it has fewer features compared to Floki Intruder.
TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F does not accept backdoor commands, nor obtain any other information about the infected computer.
It only connects to the server to send possible credit card logs that the scraper has gathered.
F sample sets we have gathered is that they appear to be version upgrades what is essentially the same binary.
That is, it appears the cybercriminal using TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F hit the same environment with progressive modifications as if doing a stress test or trial-and-error.
For instance, one set contained Searcher.dll seen in RDASRV, an older PoS RAM scraper malware.
Newer sets contain RAM scraping functionality of NewPOSThings, dropped with the filename rservices.exe.

Defending against FighterPOS

Trend Micro protects customers from all threats related to FighterPOS and its new variants.
To protect enterprises from bots and malware with PoS RAM-scraping capabilities, it is best to employ endpoint application control or whitelisting technology, included in the Trend Micro Smart Protection Suite, to keep you in control of the applications that run on your network.
Companies can also consider Trend Micro Deep Discovery, which has specialized detection engines and custom sandboxing that can detect evasive attacker activities like the anti-sandboxing techniques mentioned in this entry.

Encrypting all HTTP traffic has long been considered a key security goal, but there have been two key obstacles to this.
First, certificates are not free and many owners are unwilling to pay; secondly the certificates themselves are not always something that could be set up by a site owner.
The Let’s Encrypt project was founded with the goal of eliminating these obstacles.
The project’s goal is to provide free certificates to all site owners; in addition, software could be set up on a web server to make the process as automated as possible.
It is backed by many major Internet companies and non-profit organizations – Akamai, Cisco, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Facebook, and Mozilla to name a few.
Let’s Encrypt only issues domain-validated certificates and not extended validation (EV) certificates, which include additional checks regarding the identity of the site owner.
Unfortunately, the potential for Let’s Encrypt being abused has always been present.
Because of this, we have kept an eye out for malicious sites that would use a Let’s Encrypt certificate.
Starting on December 21, we saw activity going to a malvertising server, with traffic coming from users in Japan.
This campaign led to sites hosting the Angler Exploit Kit, which would download a banking Trojan (BKDR_VAWTRAK.
AAAFV) onto the affected machine.
Daily hits to malvertising server

We believe that this attack is a continuation of the same malvertising campaign we first identified in September that also targeted Japanese users.
How was this attack carried out?
The malvertisers used a technique called “domain shadowing”.
Attackers who have gained the ability to create subdomains under a legitimate domain do so, but the created subdomain leads to a server under the control of the attackers.
In this particular case, the attackers created ad.
{legitimate domain}.
com under the legitimate site.
Note that we are disguising the name of this site until its webmasters are able to fix this problem appropriately

Traffic to this created subdomain was protected with HTTPS and a Let’s Encrypt certificate, as shown below:



Figure 2.
Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate

The domain hosted an ad which appeared to be related to the legitimate domain to disguise its traffic.
Parts of its redirection script have also been moved from a JavaScript file into a .
GIF file to make identifying the payload more difficult.
Anti-AV code similar to what we found in the September attack is still present.
In addition, it uses an open DoubleClick redirect – a tactic previously discussed by Kafeine of Malware don’t need Coffee.

Figure 3.
Code used by malvertising

Any technology that is meant for good can be abused by cybercriminals, and digital certificates like those of Let’s Encrypt’s is no exception.
As a certificate authority ourselves we are aware of how the SSL system of trust can be abused.
Cases like this one where an attacker is able to create subdomains under a legitimate domain name demonstrate a problem.
A certificate authority that automatically issues certificates specific to these subdomains may inadvertently help cybercriminals, all with the domain owner being unaware of the problem and unable to prevent it.
Domain-validation certificates only confirm that the relevant domain is under the control of the site recipient.
In theory, this should not validate the identity of the recipient.
However, end users less aware of the nuances of certificates may miss the differences, and as a result, these DV certificates can help the hacker gain legitimacy with the public.
While Let’s Encrypt has stated that they do not believe CAs should act as a content filter, they do check domains that it issues against the Google safe browsing API.
Ideally, CAs should be willing to cancel certificates issued to illicit parties that have been abused by various threat actors.
However, security on the infrastructure is only possible when all critical players – browsers, CAs, and anti-virus companies – play an active role in weeding out bad actors.
A key takeaway from the malvertising incident is that website owners should ensure that they secure their own website control panels, to ensure that new subdomains beyond their control are not created without their knowledge.
At the same time, users should also be aware that a “secure” site is not necessarily a safe site, and we also note that the best defense against exploit kits is still keeping software up-to-date to minimize the number of vulnerabilities that may be exploited.
We have notified Let’s Encrypt about this particular certificate being abused.

Updated on January 7, 2016, 3:20 AM PST (UTC -8): We have updated this entry to clarify our mention of Let’s Encrypt in relation to the reported malvertising incident and in response to the points raised by security researcher Ryan Hurst about CAs.
Let’s Encrypt was the CA used in this case, but other CAs may be abused by other threat actors to launch similar attacks.
We also clarified our positions regarding DV certificates, and reworded the last paragraph to emphasize the value of holistic solution and security posture in all aspects of an infrastructure.

Fileless infections are exactly what their namesake says: they’re infections that don’t involve malicious files being downloaded or written to the system’s disk.
While fileless infections are not necessarily new or rare, it presents a serious threat to enterprises and end users given its capability to gain privileges and persist in the system of interest to an attacker—all while staying under the radar.
For instance, fileless infections have been incorporated in a targeted bot delivery, leveraged to deliver ransomware, infect point-of-sale (PoS) systems, and perpetrate click fraud.
The key point of the fileless infection for the attacker is to be able to evaluate each compromised system and make a decision whether the infection process should continue or vanish without a trace.
The cybercriminal group Lurk was one of the first to effectively employ fileless infection techniques in large-scale attacks—techniques that arguably became staples for other malefactors.
A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware.
The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms.
No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn’t interesting to the Lurk operators.
This eponymous lurking behavior would earn them notoriety until their operations were stymied and the perpetrators arrested.
Nine more suspected members of the group were arrested by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs on February 8.
Lurk was believed to have siphoned over $45 million from financial organizations, ultimately disrupting the victims’ operations, reputation, and bottom line.
How did Lurk evolve from a clique of threat actors to a full-fledged cybercriminal group?
How did their operations shift from targeting Russian end users to banks and enterprises?
Our observations of the group were based on code artifacts we analyzed as well as network traffic and URL patterns our intrusion detection systems monitored within several organizations in the Russian Internet segment during Lurk’s five-year campaign.
The group already implemented certain mechanisms to prevent AV detection.
Requests during a time period or from a source IP address that didn’t match their preferred distribution area, for instance, would yield a redirect to a third-party site such as Google.
Lurk compromised systems by exploiting web browser vulnerabilities via drive-by download attacks.
Malicious iframe content was injected to high-profile Russian websites, which then served as watering holes to attack unsuspecting end users.
Malvertising and poisoning of content-serving application components, such as memcached cache poisoning, were also part of their traffic redirection methods.
Stealth was already a fixture in their operations.
Before additional malware was served to a victim, the victim machine was first verified and validated with a bodiless payload (executed in memory) that collected information from the compromised machine.
During this time we developed URL-based signatures and used them to detect Lurk-related network traffic.
The signature pattern ^[A-Z0-9]{4}$ was particularly effective in detecting URL patterns employed by Lurk from 2011 to 2013.
The average TTL (Time To Live – the period of time these signatures were effective) for these signatures was two to three months.
The validity time of the signatures also allowed us to identify the group’s software upgrade cycles.
Mid-2012 to mid-2014: Honing the Craft

Lurk was most prolific during this period, with its series of URL redirection campaigns in Russia becoming more extensive.
High-profile and high-volume websites were used as intermediate platforms for diverting unknowing visitors to their exploit kit, known as XXX.
Lurk also targeted programmatic advertising infrastructures to increase the scale of their operations.
In February 2012, for instance, the ad server of news agency RIA Novosti, ria[.]
ru, was found serving iframe redirects to Lurk’s systems.
The campaign delivered the actual payload only to a select range of IP addresses.
By August 2012, we were able to observe sequences of HTTP requests during and after infection, including command and control (C&C) communication from compromised machines.
When 2014 rolled in, Lurk started exhibiting some patterns similar with the Angler exploit kit.
For example, Lurk increasingly used indexm[.]
html as their landing URL pattern; this would also shortly appear in one of Angler’s payloads.

ru (February 2012)

ru banner network


Figure 4.
Malicious iframe content served by tks[.]
ru (August 2013)

Lurk’s transition from simple web-browser-exploiting crooks to organized cybercriminals also stood out.
Range and frequency were added to their operations.
While Lurk only exploited a certain set of browser vulnerabilities, the exploit code also often changed.
Larger payloads (in number of bytes) typically translated to more functionality being embedded in them, while a smaller change indicated a repacked payload.
True to its namesake, Lurk developed techniques to evade sandbox-based detection.
Aside from serving malicious content only once per IP address, the group limited the range of IP addresses to a subset of targets of interest.
Payload execution was done in multi-tier, chained fashion, and only components delivered at later stages had persistence mechanisms.
The initial bodiless payload was designed to be triggered by the exploit kit shellcode, which performed routine checks in the infected machine.
It would then call back to the group’s C&C server in the form of a Windows executable that, in turn, performs another analysis of the affected system and collected system information, such as installed software packages and their versions, operating system information and so on.
This information was sent back to the C&C server which made decisions on what to do next.
This exhaustive scrutiny, along with the campaign’s objective, determines whether additional modules would be dropped to the system.
Sourcing samples from this was a challenge because the payload’s behavior was mostly influenced by the environment where it was executed.
Acquiring additional modules of the group’s malware, for instance, was nearly impractical if the exploit URLs were loaded in a sandboxed environment.
Malicious content were also often distributed during lunchtime (Moscow’s timezone), and in very short intervals.
We surmise this as their way to hide from automated scraping sandbox detection.
Geographical information of each visiting IP address was actively crosschecked against their regions of interest—Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Exploits were also served with higher frequency on certain days of the week: Fridays, and days before public holidays.
Lurk’s infrastructure also exhibited new capabilities.
Among them were distinct patterns used in the HTTP requests and hosting providers.
Based on the hosting providers they used and timing of their hosting migrations, we observed the group compromising websites of software distribution companies and tampered their software installation files.
Their attacks also exploited a number of vulnerabilities that included authentication portal bypass flaws in programmatic ad servers, and those in web servers and other web components.
The mechanisms of redirections were different for each intermediate victim.
Some included ad banner networks or actual sites—while the website content-serving component was poisoned in others.

Figure 5.
Lurk’s intermediate targets by year

2014 to 2016: Going Global

2014 was a significant year in Lurk’s history.
A number of high-profile, intermediate victims were still at their fingertips, giving them footholds into the user’s systems.
In a word, they were on a roll.
Why not go global to turn in more profit?
Most of the domains Lurk used during this time were purchased from third-party resellers and paid with WebMoney checks and other anonymous forms of payment available in Russia.
The activities we observed indicated dry runs of malicious injections in banner networks outside Russia and CIS.
In April, we saw Lurk using redirects via mail[.]
ru, possibly through malicious injections to its ad server content.
From June to September, Lurk’s landing pages hinted at the group migrating their infrastructure and readying a global campaign.
By the second half of the year, Lurk’s geographical distribution drastically changed.
ru domains were manually inspected.
Lurk then launched a new URL pattern that served payloads round-the-clock, eschewing pre-filtering of IP address locations in favor of targeting global IP addresses.
While Lurk favored Java exploits that were used extensively from 2011 to 2012, Flash/swf content was introduced.
An obfuscated Flash file exploiting CVE-2013-5330 was spotted in December 2014.
It was delivered only if the victim’s source IP address (and time) met Lurk’s parameters—otherwise users received a 404 error response.
As mentioned earlier, the XXX Exploit Kit used by Lurk demonstrated several URL-serving patterns and fileless infection capabilities that would later be seen in Angler.
By early 2015, the difference in Lurk and Angler’s activities began to blur—many of their patterns, exploit techniques, and distribution volume overlapped.
Correlation via hosting IP addresses wasn’t very helpful, because Lurk and Angler were often seen hosted on the same service providers.
Lurk also employed dynamically generated domain names for their landing pages.
2016: Lurk’s Downfall

Lurk’s active compromise of financial institutions led to a series of enquiries that culminated in the arrest of over 50 individuals involved in its operations across Russia.
The ripple effect led other cybercriminal groups to lie low for the rest of the year.
Other exploit kits like Neutrino and Magnitude either shut down or went private.
Coincidence?
Based on the similarities of Angler and XXX’s exploit-serving URL patterns and malware delivery techniques (particularly their use of fileless infection) as well as shared infrastructure, we can construe a correlation of both their operations.
In a way, the rise and fall of Lurk also reflected the evolution of the threat landscape.
We can only predict the constant development of seemingly novel and unforeseen techniques for evading traditional security systems, which is exacerbated by how these can become commercially available to other bad guys.
Best Practices

Lurk’s story demonstrates the aptitude of cybercriminals for honing in on specific victims and profiting from them.
Whether spying for profit, pilfering credentials, emptying bank accounts, or misinforming an unknowing public, bad guys will progressively develop attacks that can neuter traditional defenses.
These threats pose greater challenges to security and IT administrators in terms of how their organization’s perimeter can be secured.
A multilayered approach is key, along with security-minded practices: apply the latest patches, block malware-hosting sites, implement URL categorization, employ firewalls and IDSs, and foster a culture of security in the workplace.
Defense in depth should also be considered—there are no silver bullets, no single network defense tool that can be used to deal with these threats.
This includes whitelisting and monitoring suspicious applications and processes, as well as well applying least privilege principles on the systems.
The attack surface—which can come in the form of software packages (including their extensions and plugins) that can interact with untrusted components—must also be reduced.
Unused browser plugins and any functionality that lets browsers execute third-party code should be inspected and disabled.
In Lurk’s case, the group favored exploiting vulnerabilities in Flash and Java plugins for web browsers.
To mitigate intrusions, direct internet access to the organization’s internal network should be disabled, and users should be obliged to utilize application proxies instead when accessing external network resources.
This should be especially enforced for HTTP and HTTPS protocols that cybercriminals frequently leverage for their attacks.
URLs and URL content (i.e. mime-types) should be stringently analyzed.
Likewise, all executable content should be considered with a grain of salt—especially if they’ve been downloaded from unknown sources.
Continuously monitoring the network for spikes of suspicious behavior—or those that may first appear as benign—can also help detect intrusion attempts.
For instance, a significant number of machines within the organization’s network suddenly attempting to resolve and connect to a domain name never observed before can indicate a network infection or exploit.
Network detection and endpoint security systems can also help notify system administrators and direct them to artifacts left by successful or failed exploit attempts.
End users must ultimately keep pace: regularly update the system, and take caution against random or socially engineered links from suspicious or spoofed emails and websites.

We’ve uncovered a new breed of point-of-sale (PoS) malware currently affecting businesses across North America and Canada: MajikPOS (detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_MAJIKPOS.
Like a lot of other PoS malware, MajikPOS is designed to steal information, but its modular approach in execution makes it distinct.
We estimate that MajikPOS’s initial infection started around January 28, 2017.
While other PoS malware FastPOS (its updated version), Gorynych and ModPOS also feature multiple components with entirely different functions like keylogging, MajikPOS’s modular tack is different.
MajikPOS needs only another component from the server to conduct its RAM scraping routine.
MajikPOS is named after its command and control (C&C) panel that receives commands and sends exfiltrated data.
MajikPOS’s operators use a combination of PoS malware and remote access Trojan (RAT) to attack their targets, to daunting effects.
MajikPOS is a reflection of the increasing complexity that bad guys are predicted to employ in their malware to neuter traditional defenses.
Entry Point and Attack Chain

Feedback from our Smart Protection Network™ enabled us to determine the methods the bad guys used to illicitly gain access to the victims’ endpoints.
Among them are Virtual Network Computing (VNC) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), poorly secured by easy-to-guess username and password combinations; and RATs previously installed in the system.
After fingerprinting the targets—ascertaining if VNC and RDP services exist and are accessible—attackers will attempt to gain access using generic credentials or via brute force.
The common denominator in the MajikPOS compromises we’ve observed involving RATs is the timeline of their infection.
If the endpoint piques the malefactors’ interest, they use a combination of VNC, RDP, RAT access, command-line FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and sometimes a modified version of Ammyy Admin—a legitimate, commercially available remote administration tool—to install MajikPOS by directly downloading the files usually hosted on free file-hosting sites.
In the case of Ammyy Admin, its file manager capability is used instead.
The modified version is sometimes named VNC_Server.exe or Remote.exe.
Configuration and C&C Communication

MajikPOS contacts its C&C server to register the infected system.
Once registered, the server then sends a “configuration” with three important entries that will be used in later steps.
Figure 1: C&C server responds with configuration details after registration

The C&C panel in these servers is called “Magic Panel”, as shown below:


Figure 2: Magic Panel’s login page

RAM-scraping Routine

Conhost.exe is the component responsible for RAM scraping (looking for credit card data on the victim’s machine).
It uses information from the configuration file for this routine.
MajikPOS checks a sizeable range of cards, such as American Express, Diners Club, Discover, Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa.
After verifying the credit card’s track data, the information is sent to the C&C server via HTTP POST, Action=”bin”.
Figure 3: Snapshot of a “Magic Dump” shop selling stolen credit card data

Online Shops for Stolen Credit Card Data

Our foray into one of MajikPOS’s C&C servers, umbpan[.]
xyz, led us to more websites with the same registrant, one of which is another Magic Panel.
The rest of the websites are “Magic Dump” shops where stolen credit card information is sold.
The Dump shops currently contain around 23,400 stolen credit card tracks, sold from US $9 to $39 each, depending on the type of card.
They can also be bought in bulk packages of 25, 50, and 100, priced at $250, $400, and $700, respectively.
Some of these websites were advertised on carding forums as early as February 2017 by a user called “MagicDumps”, who has been updating the forums for new dumps based on location—mostly in the U.S. and Canada.
MajikPOS’s Timeline

Here is a rough timeline of events related to MajikPOS, based on our findings:



Other MajikPOS Tricks

MajikPOS was written using .
NET.
It’s an uncommon technique, but not unheard of.
GamaPOS, discovered in 2015, was the first documented PoS malware to use the .
NET framework.
MajikPOS, like many of today’s malware, uses encrypted communication to make it harder to detect on the network level.
It took advantage of open RDP ports, similar to other related threats like Operation Black Atlas.
We also spotted instances where MajikPOS’s operators utilized commonly used lateral movement hacking tools.
This can be an indication of their attempts to further access the victim’s network.
In separate incidents, we saw a command-line tool abused to deploy MajikPOS, along with other PoS malware.
MajikPOS is also notable with how it tries to hide by mimicking common file names in Microsoft Windows.
Mitigation

Properly configured chip-and-pin credit cards with end-to-end encryption (EMVs) should be unaffected by this threat.
Unfortunately, terminals that don’t support them are at risk to threats like MajikPOS.
While the U.S. has adopted EMVs—thanks to the implementation of the EMV Liability Shift last October 2015—the transition has been a challenge.
While businesses and consumers across the country are increasingly deploying and using chip-based PoS terminals, many merchants, for instance, still haven’t implemented the PIN part of the chip-and-PIN process.
Although the use of EMV Chip-and-PIN credit cards is not a silver bullet, EMVs are still a more secure alternative compared to magnetic stripe-based credit cards that are most affected by PoS malware like MajikPOS.
In fact, MasterCard and Visa reported a decline in credit card fraud since utilizing EMV-enabled cards and PoS systems.
It would also be useful to take note of a good PoS Defense Model.
To further mitigate MajikPOS, it’s recommended to properly secure remote access functionalities like remote desktops and VNC, especially when these expose the host or system to the internet.
For infosec professionals and IT/system administrators who protect their organization’s endpoints, consulting the appropriate documentation for securing Remote Desktop and VNC is a good place to start.
Trend Micro Solutions

Endpoint application control or whitelisting can be employed to reduce attack exposure by ensuring only updates associated with whitelisted applications can be installed.
Trend Micro’s OfficeScan™ has many security features including Behavior Monitoring, which can be used to detect these names (csrss.exe and conhost.exe) by the event, “Duplicated System File”.
Trend Micro’s Deep Discovery Inspector can be used to determine attempts to perform lateral movement and possible brute-force activity.
MajikPOS’s C&C traffic is already blocked by Trend Micro™ Web Reputation Services.
Trend Micro’s advanced endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites, and Trend Micro™ Worry-Free™ Business Security provide both detection and blocking of all the relevant, malicious files and C&C traffic.
Implementing application control in PoS devices also significantly mitigates similar attacks by ensuring that only whitelisted applications are allowed to execute.

In early February, several financial organizations reported malware infection on their workstations, apparently coming from legitimate websites.
The attacks turned out to be part of a large-scale campaign to compromise trusted websites in order to infect the systems of targeted enterprises across various industries.
The strategy is typically known as a “watering hole” attack.
It was all sparked by a spate of recent malware attacks on Polish banks entailing a reportedly unknown malware in their own terminals and servers, along with the presence of dubious, encrypted programs/executables, and more prominently, suspicious network activity.
More malware are delivered to the affected systems which were seen connecting to unusual and far-flung locations worldwide, possibly where company data are exfiltrated to.
The malware in question: RATANKBA.
Not only was it tied to malware attacks against banks in Poland, but also in a string of similar incidents involving financial institutions in Mexico, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, and Chile.
Were there other malware involved?
Does the campaign really have ties with a Russian cybercriminal group?
Based on the odd wording choices (in Russian) we saw used as commands within the malware, we construe that it is just a decoy—a tactic to obfuscate the attackers’ trails.
Banks weren’t the only targets; among them are also enterprises in telecommunications, management consulting, information technology, insurance, aviation, and education.
Also, the campaign wasn’t just confined to North America and Europe, as we also observed a number of affected organizations in the APAC region, notably Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.
Here we provide further analysis and insights that can complement other ongoing research into this threat.
One of the possible infection flows involving RATANKBA

Figure 1.
One of the possible infection flows involving RATANKBA

Infection Flow

The campaign, like what we saw in affected Polish banks, has many attack chains.
The tools and techniques employed are typical in targeted attacks due to elements of lateral movement and reconnaissance.
Malefactors used watering hole attacks to compromise legitimate and trusted websites frequently visited by their targets.
These websites were injected with malicious JavaScript code that fingerprints browser components and loads vulnerability exploits from their malware and exploit kit-hosting systems, some of which were also likely compromised.
The infection is multistage and involves a variety of malware, with the final payload delivered only to their targets of interest.
Different command and control (C&C) servers were used.
Some were also compromised machines that proxied connections to the attackers’ infrastructure.
In one instance we observed, one of the initial malware delivered to the victim, RATANKBA (TROJ_RATANKBA.
A), connects to a legitimate but compromised website (eye-watch[.]
in:443, a mobile application-selling site) from which a hack tool (nbt_scan.
exe) is also downloaded.
The domain also serves as one of the campaign’s platform for C&C communication.
The threat actor uses RATANKBA to survey the lay of the land as it looks into various aspects of the host machine where it has been initially downloaded—the machine that has been victim of the watering hole attack.
Information such as the running tasks, domain, shares, user information, if the host has default internet connectivity, and so forth.
Figure 2.
RATANKBA looking at different aspects of the machine

Figure 2.
RATANKBA looking at different aspects of the machine

It would be worthwhile to note that RATANKBA has also been seen looking at specific IP ranges of interest:

Figure 3.
RATANKBA looking for specific IP ranges

Figure 3.
RATANKBA looking for specific IP ranges

Our analysis of samples of the hack tool (HKTL_NBTSCAN.
GA and HKTL_NBTSCAN.
GB) indicate it as a command-line program that scans IP networks for NetBIOS information such as IP address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in username, and MAC address—with some of the information coming from the initial RATAKNBA installation.
The threat actor can now combine the information and brute force their way throughout the network (through NetBIOS) using a list of usernames and passwords as well as a range of IP addresses.
Figure 2 Command line instructions of the hack tool

Figure 4.
Commandline instructions of the hack tool

Upon successful connection, this hack tool will try to copy the calc.exe of the attacker’s machine to the targeted computer’s network share (C$) to test if file propagation via network share is successful and would most likely succeed if the credentials used would have administrative privileges.
It then takes note of the infected machine’s IP address, user, domain, hostname, OS and Service Pack, and the username and password combination that worked during the brute force routine.
A log of it is then dumped to the directory where the file was initially executed.
With the combination of the information from RATANKBA and success/failure results from HKTL_NBTSCAN, the threat actor is now free to deploy final payloads to interesting hosts.
A banking Trojan (TSPY_BANKER.
NTE) is among RATANKBA’s final payloads.
Some of the compromised sites used by attacker host several malware and suspicious/malicious files include:

An information-stealing backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_DESTOVER.
ADU),
A similarly named Flash file (swf, detected as SWF_EXPLOYT.
YYRQ)
A Silverlight (.
xap) file containing several files: an App Manifest (AppManifest.xaml), and DLLs Shell_siver.dll (TROJ_CVE20130074.
B), and System.Xml.Linq.dll, which when repacked form a runtime remote code execution exploit for Silverlight (CVE-2016-0034, patched last January 12, 2016)
A Trojan (TROJ64_KLIPODLDR.
ZHEB-A) that drops an encrypted module (BKDR64_KLIPODENC.
ZHEB-A) containing a banking spyware (TSPY64_BANKER.
YWNQD), used as a Windows service persistence mechanism DLL.
Impact

There were actually more victims than what was initially gauged.
Feedback from our Smart Protection Network™ revealed that apart from attacks in North America (mainly the U.S.), Europe, and South America, the campaign also noticeably affected enterprises in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Bahrain.
The targeted industries were consistent with other analyses: telecommunications (including internet service providers) and banking.
We also saw a miscellany of targets whose industries comprise internet-related services (such as data center operations), management consulting, information technology, pharmaceutics, insurance, even aviation and education.
In the case of Taiwan, we’ve seen the compromised website diverting its visitors to another malware-hosting site that also acts as platform for C&C communication: sap[.]
misapor[.]
ch.
We saw the affected websites of financial institutions in Uruguay and Mexico redirecting victims to the same URL.
While the URL acts similarly to how eye-watch[.]
in:443 delivers payloads, we also saw the URL leveraging and exploiting security flaws in Flash: CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019, and CVE-2016-4117.

A False Flag?
The campaign notably bears similarities with activities that seem to point the finger to Russian perpetrators.
Is there really a Russian connection?
Delving into the malware, we found that it indeed uses commands in Russian—transliterated from Cyrillic script to Latin alphabet, in particular.
The verbs used were in their infinitive form, however, which is awkward for a command switch.
Case in point: the use of “ustanavlivat” (“to install”) instead of the more command-like “ustanovit” (“do install”), which gives the impression that the malware operator lifted it from a dictionary or source where words are typically listed in default form.
Additionally, using verbs as commands is peculiar, especially for Russian cybercriminals or malware programmers who ironically eschew using Russian language in favor of broken English.
Majority—if not all—of Russian programmers know that “connect” is keyed in as “connect”, because there’s already an API call (Application Program Interface) under that name.
If you really have to use Russian, you’d rather use words like “vykhod” (“quit”) than “vikhodit” (“to exit”).
Another example is the use of “klyent2podklychit” we found within the sample we analyzed.
The only intelligible part of it was “2”, which can be taken as “to” given how there’s an API call name for it (client2connect).
In Russian, it’s practically gibberish, with the words wrongly ordered; it makes much more sense if “podkluchit_klienta” was used instead.
Indeed, with the awkward use of Russian language within the malware, we’re inclined to surmise it as more of a false flag, intentionally inserted in the code to flummox threat research and attribution attempts.
It’s an uncommon tactic, but one that’s already been observed in other malware and cyberattacks.
Were the attacks carried out by cybercriminal group Lazarus?
While there is ambivalence if they were indeed their handiwork, our analysis indicates that the malware codes and techniques employed resembled those used by Lazarus.
Mitigation

Security and system/IT administrators must practice due diligence in protecting their websites and web-based applications from threats that can undermine their security, and hijack them to do the bad guys’ bidding—delivering malware to their victims.
Malicious web injections, for instance, leverage exploits that enable attackers to gain footholds into the system.
An organization’s best defense is to regularly apply the latest patches, as well as routinely scan and examine traffic that goes through the enterprise’s network, which enables prompt incident response and remediation.
A multilayered approach is a must to securing the organization’s perimeter, especially for information security professionals and system/IT administrators.
Hardening the endpoints is critical, as bad guys can use these to enter the company network.
Implementing the apt restrictions/permissions policies on end user systems and employing application control can help prevent unwanted and suspicious applications and processes from being executed.
Disabling unnecessary—or unused—components in the system such as third-party plugins and extensions helps reduce the system’s attack surface.
Employing firewalls and intrusion detection systems on top of proactive network monitoring can help mitigate incursions into the organization.
This can be complemented by restricting direct internet access to the company’s internal networks while using proxies to access external resources.
End users can help by practicing and fostering security habits, such as prudence against dubious and socially engineered links, emails, and websites.

You can now check the results of our ongoing research into EyePyramid; this blog post dives into EyePyramid’s behavior and other interesting details from our technical analysis.
Two Italian citizens were arrested last Tuesday by Italian authorities (in cooperation with the FBI) for exfiltrating sensitive data from high-profile Italian targets.
Private and public Italian citizens, including those holding key positions in the state, were the subject of a spear-phishing campaign that reportedly served a malware, codenamed EyePyramid, as a malicious attachment.
This malware was used to successfully exfiltrate over 87 gigabytes worth of data including usernames, passwords, browsing data, and filesystem content.
Infection chain

Based on the available information and our initial analysis from the samples, it appears that the attacker behind the spear-phishing campaign managed to compromise email accounts, particularly those belonging to attorneys and associates in several law firms.
We see this as a lure used by the hacker to bait a target into opening a malicious email attachment.
Once opened, the malicious attachment, which is actually the aforementioned malware, bootstraps and concludes its loading routine by planting a copy of itself with a pseudo-random name and an .
exe extension.
Among some of the known names we found (which could change in other versions and builds of the malware):



Figure 1.
File names used

Initial sample analysis

The malware may initially appear to be a naïve piece of code written in .
NET (>= 4.5.
x), but an in-depth look reveals otherwise.
After standard obfuscation, which can be reversed with off-the-shelf tools, the sensitive parts of the decompiled source code are obfuscated, which made detection and analysis trickier.
For instance, information about the command & control server’s URL and the MailBee’s license key (allegedly purchased under the attacker’s name), were heavily obfuscated, as the following excerpt of code shows:



Figure 2.
Obfuscated code sample

Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the de-obfuscation routine includes a decryption step, based on the 3DES cipher, along with MD5 followed by SHA256 of the input data.
The malware sends the exfiltrated data (after encrypting it) to the command & control servers over standard web transports:



Figure 3.
Code for exfiltrating traffic

Note that part of the endpoint’s URL is not obfuscated:



Figure 4.
Exposed part of URL (Click thumbnail above for full code)

The malware also used the MailBee.NET.dll APIs—a paid library used for building mail software—to send the exfiltrated data out to dropzones (i.e., email addresses) in use by the attacker.
It is interesting to note that the purchase of the paid library has led the authorities to the identity of the person behind the campaign.
We are currently analyzing this malware and the campaign that used this is under further monitoring.
We’ll update this entry once further verified information and details have been uncovered.

The TorrentLocker ransomware, which has been in a lull as of late, has recently come back with new variants (Detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_CRYPTLOCK.
DLFLVS and RANSOM_CRYPTLOCK.
DLFLVU).
These new variants are using a delivery mechanism that uses abused Dropbox accounts.
This new type of attack is in line with our 2017 prediction that ransomware would continue to evolve beyond the usual attack vectors.
TorrentLocker has continued to remain active beyond its peak, with its low detection rates allowing the cybercriminals behind it to work behind the scenes while continuing attacks against unwitting victims.
A familiar foe in a new disguise

The new TorrentLocker variants have similar behavior as the previous examples we’ve detected, with the primary changes being its new distribution method and the way the malware executable itself is packaged.
An example of the new TorrentLocker attack begins with an email claiming to be an invoice from a supplier of the organization where the victim works.
The “invoice” itself does not come as an email attachment, but is accessed instead via a Dropbox link that contains text referencing bills, invoices or account numbers to make it seem authentic.
Using Dropbox as a URL link allows TorrentLocker to evade gateway sensors since there is no attachment and the link is from a legitimate website.
Figure 1: Example of a TorrentLocker phishing email

Once the user clicks on the link, a JavaScript file (JS_NEMUCOD) disguised as the invoice document will be downloaded to the victim’s computer.
When the user tries to open the fake invoice, another obfuscated JavaScript file will be downloaded to memory, after which the TorrentLocker payload will be downloaded and executed in the system.
A notable feature of the new TorrentLocker variants is that they are packaged as NSIS installers to avoid detection, a technique also used by other prominent ransomware such as CERBER, LOCKY, SAGE and SPORA.
Scope of Attacks

From February 26 to March 6, 2017 our Smart Protection Network detected 54,688 spam emails which included URLs going to 815 different DropBox accounts.
The bulk of this attack occured in Europe, with Germany and Norway taking up the largest percentage.
Attacks in Norway peaked during the end of February but gradually shifted to Germany during early March.
The ransomware’s perpetrators pulled off the largest number of attacks during the weekdays with a lull during the weekends.
We discovered significant increases in infections at approximately 9 to 10 am, coinciding with the start of the work day—most likely from employees checking their daily emails for the first time.
Organizations commonly use Dropbox  to manage and transfer their files, which can result in unsuspecting employees getting tricked into believing that the URL contained in the email is legitimate.
Figure 2: Timeline showing the peak hours of the attacks




Figure 3: Distribution of attacks

We are currently working with Dropbox on this issue.
As per Dropbox’s security team, all files discovered at the time of publishing have been taken down and their respective users banned.
Mitigating TorrentLocker

Given the deceptive nature of the new TorrentLocker and other similar ransomware, organizations should take extra steps to ensure that they are protected from these kinds of social engineering attacks.
The number one priority should be educating their employees on the best practices against phishing attacks, which includes checking any email for suspicious content such as the sender’s display name or any mismatched URLs.
In fact, end users should be advised to refrain from downloading attachments or clicking embedded links in general, unless they are absolutely certain that it comes from a legitimate source.
Users should also take steps to ensure that their data is backed up by implementing the 3-2-1 backup policy, which involves saving at least three copies of data, with two copies in different storage types—preferably on an internal and removable drive—and one copy off-site.
Trend Micro Solutions

In addition to the best practices suggested above, Trend Micro customers can use the following solutions to further mitigate ransomware threats like TorrentLocker:

==========
F :

A long time ago, in the prehistoric digital era, in a world of big trees while we were a mere bonsai, we started throwing a yearly conference for a select few of the most forward-thinking experts in information security.
We christened the conference the Security Analyst Summit (SAS for short), and right from the get-go we wanted to make it the best event of its kind in the world.
And when I say best, I mean both in terms of content:
…And in terms of a relaxed and fun atmosphere:
And to make the best even more memorable for all who take part in it, we traditionally throw SAS at a location with among the most unbearable conditions in the world.
That is, always next to beach in a tropical clime :) Example:
Security Analyst Summit 2015 took place in Cancun, Mexico
Security Analyst Summit 2016 took place in Tenerife, Spain
And here we are again on the eve of another SAS.
This year’s will be on the island of St. Maarten in the Caribbean (April 2-6), so there’ll be no shortage of beachiness and oceanity.
And of course there’ll be no shortage of the world’s top cybersecurity experts who’ll be telling all sorts of scary stories about who’s been hacked, where, and how, and what needs to be done in response.
So get involved; it’s gonna be thrilling, I promise (it always is :).
Since the first ever SAS, cyberthreats and the digital landscape on the whole have been transformed so as to be unrecognizable.
Back then there were no smartphones, for example.
And digital attacks on industrial systems were of interest to no one beside geeks, paranoids, fantasists and futurists – also the dogs of cyberwar, for whom a whole new cyber-landscape for military operations was opening up.
And there was no Stuxnet either!
Back then IT security had a very narrow focus.
Accordingly, the conference started out as an internal get-together for our own experts from around the globe.
Only later did it become an industry-wide get-together, in keeping with the times: as the threat of cyberattacks became one of the main topics on agendas at corporate, national and international levels, while financial services, Internet trading and the Internet of Things were entering practically every home.
As it went more and more industry-wide, SAS also became more interesting to a broader range of cybersecurity folks – from all sorts of different types of companies.
Larger and larger sponsors got involved, and the list of accredited media in attendance grew, with larger and more influential global media outlets reporting next to their specialized trade press siblings.
So what can we expect at this year’s SAS?
Detailed presentations on investigations into the world’s most complex and advanced cyberattacks.
Discussion of trends.
Where’s the world heading; what will be the cyberthreats of the future, and how will we survive them.
A practical part: training sessions from our experts.
These allow large companies to create and develop their own teams of cyberthreat hunters.
Investigations into the problems of industrial security.
This is a new but already veeerrry hot topic, with SAS being one of the very few forums in the world set up for seriously deep discussion of issues of industrial control systems’ security, the Internet of Things, driverless vehicles and other such hotness.
In fact, it’s the one of the most widely believed myths in the infosec world.
At the same time, it’s the most non-standard one.
That double-sided nature is likely the reason why the myth is so enduring.
Fact or Fiction: can a virus actually damage PC hardware?
At the dawn of the PC era, the late 20th century, users frequently spread scary stories that happened “to one of good friends of theirs,” from a virus.
In such stories, viruses, for instance, fed some ‘wrong’ interlacing to a CRT monitor and ‘burned out’ the PC’s hardware components.
In other tales, malware made HDD plates ‘resonate’ fiercely, ultimately destroying hard drives.
Or overclocked a floppy drive to cause an imminently deadly rotor overheat.
Sure some of these cases are theoretically plausible, but built-in foolproof protection mechanisms don’t allow such failures to happen.
So, as they say, sleep tight, little friends, they shall not pass, and all that kind of stuff.
Fact or Fiction: can a #virus actually damage PC hardware?
#infosec
Anything can happen, after all, with vendors hushing up things.
Yet, life is a curious thing and full of surprises.
For example, back in 1999 a massive Win95.CIH (a.k.a. Chernobyl) virus pandemic took over thousands of machines.
That malware corrupted data stored both on a hard drive and on BIOS chips on motherboards.
Some of the affected PCs would not start as their boot program was damaged.
To level the adverse effects of the attack, one had to replace BIOS chips and rewrite the data.
Was that effectively a physical damage inflicted on a PC?
In reality, no.
After a series of manipulations motherboards could be cured and returned to the operating state.
But the problem could not be solved by standard ‘home emergency kit’ and required specialized equipment.
Today, everything is even more confusing.
First, any standalone piece of hardware is bundled with a rewritable microprogram, at times with even more than one.
I’m surprised this trend did not affect screws which hold this too smart hardware together.

Indestructible malware by #Equation cyberspies exists, but don’t panic yet: https://kas.pr/4npm  #EquationAPT
Each of those microprograms has been evolving for years, having become quite a complex piece of software, which is by design potentially open to an attack.
Once the attack is successful, the consequences are not always immediately remediable.
Take the story about modified firmware of hard drives.
For the record, while analyzing the Equation cyberespionage campaign, Kaspersky Lab experts explored spyware modules injected into microprogram code for a number of different HDD models.
These pieces of malware are used to gain complete control over the affected disk; which cannot be remedied even by formatting.

One cannot change the firmware by means of a standard toolset — the firmware is responsible for updating itself.
As you would expect, it puts a hell of a fight when someone tries to lure it from where it belongs.
Of course, if you happen to be in possession of specialized equipment, you might be able to apply force and change any microprogram.
In real life, an affected drive goes straight to the trash – it’s the most cost-effective option.
Can it be considered physical damage?
But the number of stories about hardware-based vulnerabilities continues to increase.

Second, it’s quite unclear what kind of machine can be defined as ‘computer.’
For instance, any current car is, to some extent, a computer — and what’ even more important – a connected computer on wheels.
It is exposed to remote hacks and compromise, as we found out in a recent well-publicized demonstration of the remote hack of a Jeep Cherokee.

Right, the hack was performed by hackers, not a virus — Ok, it was a piece of cake, given years of research this hack took.
However, it won’t come as a surprise if an attack like that will end up with a car hitting some pole on the roadside.
I guess this can be called damage.
So, can a virus actually damage PC hardware?
Is it fact or fiction?
That’s truth.
However, the answer here heavily depends on what you actually mean by “damage”, “virus”, “PC”, etc.
We’ve written about insecure fingerprint sensors and other biometric technologies a lot.
We were not alone, of course.
It looks like the fuss did some good.
Fingerprint sensor evolution
IDEX, a Norwegian company that ships fingerprint sensors for LG and other companies, claims that the majority of its partner smartphone developers enable access to fingerprint sensors’ data only within a secure environment.
I talked to several fingerprint sensor makers at MWC, and all of them use a fully protected scheme for handling such data.
In the beginning, “raw” data from a fingerprint sensor is encrypted, then the system detects distinctive ridges, encrypts them as well, and sends to secure storage.
All of these operations take place in a trusted execution environment — an isolated space that cannot be accessed by any outer process.
Yet, several sensor makers still let gadget companies decide if they want to use the protection mechanism.
Regardless, data is always securely encrypted on the way from sensor to processor, and that’s good: Previously, the main vulnerability of fingerprint reading technologies was right here.
A sensor maker called CrucialTec decided to make biometrics even more … well, biometric, adding heart-rate sensors to fingerprint scanners.
It’s a protective measure: 3D-printed finger copies, plaster fingers, and even real fingers cut off of their owners will not work.
The same holds true for simple copies of finger ridges created with a common printer.
MWC 2017: bank card with fingerprint sensor
This system checks ridges to confirm that they are similar but doesn’t unlock the smartphone until it detects a proper heartbeat.
This is a serious step ahead in fingerprint authentication security.
Resourceful criminals will no doubt find a way to trick this protection as well — for example, with a copy of a finger’s ridges pressed to the scanner using the real, live finger of a different person — but it will be much harder.
One Chinese company presented an unusual implementation: a fingerprint scanner built directly into the glass of a smartphone display.
There were a few limitations: first, the only sample remained in China, and so the company could not show it.
In addition they are not completely sure how users will understand which part of the display they should tap to get in — the sensor is not clearly visible!
Last year IDEX presented a similar idea, but it seems that it didn’t go further than a concept.
By the way, developers say fingerprint sensors are not limited to gadgets; they can be built into door locks or car keys.
Several companies offer flexible and very thin sensors that can be used as a part of banking card.
MWC 2017: door lock with fingerprint sensor
The technology is implemented in various ways: For example, IDEX offers a scheme that does not require an additional supply of electricity, whereas CrucialTec builds a battery and a simple display into the card to show if the user is successfully authorized or not.
The fingerprint sensor can be a good alternative to PIN codes: easier to use and harder to fake — it’s very easy to spy a PIN when a person enters it.
A little more biometry
Two years ago, Qualcomm presented SenseID — more secure and quick ultrasonic fingerprints scanners.
This time, the company offered another authentication method that scans your iris.
Every person has unique irises, so this authentication method is quite reliable.
Qualcomm’s system is new, so it’s built only into prototypes for now, but it works surprisingly well: quickly and without mistakes.
In case you’re wondering why this technology is so late in coming to the smartphone market, the reason is simple: Earlier cameras were too slow, and imaging processors were less powerful.
By the way, Qualcomm’s iris recognition system can distinguish a fake copy of an iris from a real eye.
There was a surprisingly realistic 3D-printed face at the Qualcomm booth, and the software did not mistake it for a real one.
As far as I understand, the system takes into account that eyes move a little all the time.
MWC 2017: fake face in Qualcomm booth
It’s noteworthy that the system can recognize irises even through big, black sunglasses.
Unfortunately, Qualcomm refuses to explain how it achieved this result.
All in all, iris recognition is much more secure than, for example, face recognition.
However, it suffers from the same problem as the rest of biometric technologies do: Once criminals find a way to steal and use biometric data (and they will surely try, if biometric ATMs become widespread), users will be stuck, not being able to change their faces, irises, or fingerprints.
We saw quite a lot of interesting innovations related to information security in Barcelona this year.
For example, Qualcomm presented on-device machine-learning technology.
Qualcomm showed first steps in this direction last year, when it presented a solution that tried to recognize objects in pictures.
Now this technology has developed into a universal engine that is compatible with many popular frameworks and given to developers.
This is a step ahead: On-device machine learning can free users from having to send data to the cloud.
And that brings privacy concepts to fields where privacy had become unimaginable, because usually machine learning requires cloud technologies — i.e., giving up our data.
It’s currently just an engine, not a consumer-ready solution.
Well, one technology already uses it — a technology developed by (you guessed it) Qualcomm.
It’s called App Protect, and it enables implementation of heuristic algorithms for the detection of malicious applications at the hardware–software level.
Qualcomm considers an app malicious if it tries to do anything secretly — gathers users’ location and contacts information, sends or intercepts SMSs, that sort of thing.
App Protect helps to detect such apps and prohibit access to sensitive data.
The technology is not a ready-to-use solution; it must be integrated into a security app.
All in all, our Kaspersky Antivirus and Security for Android does it efficiently at the software level.
MWC 2017 more focused on security than in previous years.
Today, you see the word “secure” at almost every booth.
Even if things aren’t really secure, the optics show that developers are starting to care more about protection.
As for biometric authentication alone, this technology may overcome the many downsides it has now.
It will never become fully secure — there’s no such thing.
But the steps we see are moving in the right direction, which gladdens us a lot.
It’s true not much malware exists in the wild for MacOS or iOS.
But there is some — and phishing sites, spammers, and carders don’t discriminate on the basis of operating system.
In addition to providing the usual navigation tools, it blocks malicious and phishing websites.
How to explore the Internet safely on your iPad and iPhone
First things first: Kaspersky Safe Browser is a free app you can download from the AppStore.
The Safe Browser interface is similar to Safari’s, so you will pick it up easily.
The browser supports most popular search engines including Google, Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo.
How Kaspersky Safe Browser protects you from online threats
The browser blocks phishing sites as well as fraudulent or spammy links by default.
That way, your private and financial data is always secured — you don’t need to set up anything, it works right out of the box.
Kaspersky Safe Browser for iOS interface and design
What’s more important, the browser protects you from even the latest threats, because it receives real-time updates from our security cloud.
That means each time we detect a malicious website, our cloud notifies Kaspersky Safe Browser, and the app adds the dangerous URLs to its blocking database.
It’s unlikely you’ll need to consult our Knowledge Base about Kaspersky Safe Browser — the app is very intuitive — but we’ll add these links just in case: Here is how to install Kaspersky Safe Browser and how to configure its settings.
When you are a serious IT company, life is freaking hard, especially on April 1.
You are expected to follow the tradition — take some lame idea, cover it as real news, and publish it with a straight face.
That’s why a year ago we did quite the opposite: We took a dead-serious issue and disguised it as a goofy April Fool’s post.
We drew public attention to the necessity of brain shielding.
Thanks to the newly instituted holiday, Tinfoil Hat Day, people all over the world learned about the invisible foes all around us, and began shielding themselves from mind-control with help of protective hats.
We were the first to answer the call and wrapped our logo in foil.

Here’s the protected version:

Meanwhile, our comrades carried out a similar important project in the Antarctic Circle related to the very same problem.
Having disguised their academic expedition as the Antarctic Biennale cultural event, and while distracting potential foes with art installations and performances, our fellow researchers tinfoiled some 20 square meters of the territory.
In this picture, you can see how the native population welcomed the relief from their constant battle against mind-control.

The data obtained from this experiment will help us protect up to 70% of Earth’s surface by the end of millennium.
In the foreseeable future, the entire solar system will be protected by a thin, shiny layer of foil, like so many frozen leftovers.
As for now, we mark the noble tradition and celebrate the 121st birthday of the tinfoil hat by protecting, if not your brain, then at least your Facebook avatar.
You can use this tool, revised and updated to repel the latest mind-control technology.
Here are some useful facts for anyone who cares about the security of their brain:
In hot weather, a tinfoil hat may be both the reason for and the consequence of overheating.

If dried fruit approaches you, see 1 for explanation.
A tinfoil hat is not sufficient to protect one from the destructive commanding force of a TV screen; we recommend wrapping the television as well.
Ancient Greeks continuously used the principles of protection from detrimental emissions: Perseus successfully protected himself from the Gorgon using Athena’s copper shield.
King Midas had the foil touch (widely misreported as the golden touch), but even putting tinfoil on everything did not save the Minoan civilization.
A foil tent could save your life as well as your mind.
At this time of year, the number of tax scams reaches a peak, with fraudsters looking for any chance to cash in on consumers, the self-employed, and small businesses that might get excited enough about potential refunds to throw caution and good sense out the window.
Many people now do their taxes online, and cybercriminals see that as a huge opportunity to make money with phishing schemes.
The IRS saw a 400% surge in phishing and malware incidents during the 2016 tax season, and that trend is likely to continue this year.
It's tax scam time
Take the recent W-2 e-mail scam, which sent victims requests for information about an employee W-2 form from a company’s payroll or human resources departments.
At this time of year, a harried staffer might not think twice.
With cybercriminals always looking for monetary gain, it’s important for consumers and businesses alike to be aware of what to look out for.
Phishing e-mails — These messages attempt to entice you into providing sensitive information by pretending to be a legitimate organization (e.g., the IRS).
Phone calls — Smooth criminals try to trick people into giving out information over the phone.
The information can then be used either to access an account directly or to send credible-looking phishing e-mails.
Apps — A fraudulent app can access information without a user realizing anything has happened.
We recommend the following top tips to stay safe when managing your tax affairs this year:
Give yourself plenty of time to file your tax return to lessen the risk that you will respond in haste to a scam;
Don’t trust advice about how to get a refund unless it comes from a tax professional or source that you trust — if in doubt, always double-check;
Don’t assume a bank or government agency has access to your tax details.
They will not have granular information about your tax return.
Even if a communication looks legitimate, check over the details first and if in doubt, contact the apparent source of the information using publicly available contact information (not details from the communication you’re trying to verify);
If using a mobile app to file your tax return, do so over a secure connection and make sure you have mobile Internet security — and that it’s up to date.
Also make sure you review permissions requested by any app before accepting them;

Do not enter your credit card details on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, to lessen the risk of passing them on to cybercriminals.
Fake sites can be made to look just like the legitimate site that they’re trying to spoof.
It’s always best to type in a URL yourself, and always check that there’s a secure connection between you and the site — look for “https” at the start of the address bar;
Install a security solution on your device, with built-in technologies designed to prevent financial fraud.
For example, the Safe Money feature in Kaspersky Lab solutions creates a secure environment for financial transactions.
The IRS gets enough of your hard-earned cash.
Don’t let the rest of it go to cybercriminals.
About a year ago, a number of people, truly passionate enthusiasts and straight-up frauds alike, started manically preaching the coming of the Blockchain Almighty.
It will change the world forever, said the Cult of the Blockchain.
The technology, they predicted, would enable ultimate transaction chain transparency thanks to the distributed ledger.
Traditional payments systems would be tossed out on the garbage heap of history.
Central banks would be transformed throughout the world.
Keeping blockchain on track while the hype fades
And forget about transactions for a sec — blockchain was set to make a lot of other things obsolete.
For example, the fanatics said, thanks to blockchain, we’ll no longer need to notarize documents, and GPS data could confirm deliveries, causing payments to be released automatically when an item arrives at its destination.
Basically, to fix the world’s imperfections, just add blockchain.
Unfortunately, neither enthusiasts nor frauds managed to explain how the magic would happen.
Worse, no one bothered to talk about blockchain’s drawbacks, except for the problem of its high performance demands, which make the technology unviable for massive transactions (say, tens of thousands of transactions per second, as is common in any modern payment system).
By end of 2016, the lively conversation had died away.
Now it’s time to give this technology a sober look and figure out what blockchain is and why it can indeed introduce some fundamental changes.
What is blockchain?
Simply put, blockchain is a chain of transactions.
Each block on the chain — or database — contains information about the previous block.
One cannot change the information without attracting notice.
Once transaction data is affirmed by miners (the controllers or keepers of the process), the block becomes iron-clad.
Its contents are open, but they are protected by a hash chain.
The database contains publicly available, unencrypted information about all transactions, signed by asymmetric key.
I don’t think it makes sense to cover the topic is deeper detail, since you can read it in a separate post.
But in essence, using blockchain we (theoretically) can obtain a reliable, initially trusted, and tamperproof database.
It’s impossible to mimic a transaction by showing a faux payment confirmation.
You cannot say you paid on time but the transaction took a long time to execute.
They say you can negotiate even with a bank, but not with blockchain.
All of your actions are carved in stone, with no government involvement needed.

Simplifying blockchain - https://kas.pr/SsH6  #bitcoin #infosec101 #banking
So, what’s the problem?
There are a lot of miners who are ready to hash blocks.
Everyone needs transparency and reliability.
And no one really likes regulators and other monopolists.
Why is blockchain nowhere to be found?
Blockchain experts say the distributed ledger cuts transaction time from days to minutes.
But there is more to the story: they’re talking about complex transactions involving higher numbers of objects and subjects.
As an example, if one were to use a blockchain-secured transaction to buy an island with a construction site, the verification and all background checks would take much less time than they would using traditional methods.
Whereas traditionally, dozens of people would need to dig into piles of documents and papers to affirm the status of the land, construction, and encumbrances, and at the same time verify the authenticity of documents, a blockchain complete these tasks in an instant.
The object of purchase is checked, the money is paid, and the next block inherits the name of the new owner.
(However, we’re setting aside the work of getting the information about the island into the blockchain: if you seriously want to use blockchain for real estate transactions you need to gather all the ownership history you can about as many properties as you can, and put it in blockchain database; otherwise it’s unlikely to work).
But for simple transactions like a person-to-person money transfer, the speed of translation does not increase — quite the opposite.
Blockchain was developed to support Bitcoin, which assumes a block takes 10 minutes to create, regardless of the equipment’s processing power.
Also, the system runs corrections after every 2,016 blocks, which adds more time.
In traditional, centralized systems such a transaction takes a fraction of a second.
Another pain point is the considerable (and constantly growing) volume of data associated with each transaction.
When megabytes of data are transferred to and fro every time a transaction of a few dollars is executed, any computing system will break.
Finally, omnipresent, crystal-clear transparency is simply not needed.
Blockchain is a high-precision, specialized tool for vast yet limited scope of use cases — not a panacea for regulators and existing payment systems.
So, nothing new?
Distributed databases are a thing of the late 80s.
Once more powerful computers were united into local and then global networks, there emerged an immediate need to enable a precise block of data to be transferred without involving the central node.
This approach was specifically interesting to the defense officials who wanted to pass a packet from A to B, being 100% sure of its integrity and the success of the transfer, regardless of any pesky troubles — like, say, a nuclear blast.
Blockchain is just one of the improved and enhanced varieties of distributed database that can be used for financial transactions both reliably and confidentially.
Some actually think that Bitcoin was created by military folks who sought ways to sponsor new rebels in the Middle East without anyone finding out.
That’s one reason regulators are a bit unsettled.
It’s great when new and exciting technology emerges, but it would be quite upsetting to find out, after years of use, that the shadowy figure who created it installed a backdoor.
A regulator we need / don’t need
In the ideal “Blockchain World” model, government plays little or no role in any transactions.
People and organizations have to agree between themselves that blockchain is reliable and should be used in transactions.
But the real world has other rules — someone big and powerful has to pull the strings.
For example, if one person promises to pay another in Bitcoins for purchased goods, and then reneges, then the wronged party needs to be able to go to court and plead for restitution or punishment.
Today, such transactions exist in a legal gray area.
For blockchain transactions to work in the real world, there needs to be a system for handling mishaps — or mischief — which means making regulations that courts can use to enforce the rules.

Here is another scenario.
One advanced bank decides to execute a blockchain transaction — and does so.
Let’s imagine the reaction of a central bank.
If the transaction was large enough, it’s entirely likely that the bank would lose its license the very same day.
That means, for such a transaction to be legitimate, the government needs to pass some acts.
Of course, blockchain might spare central banks having to manage the control and validation of transactions.
But regulation and enforcement are still necessary; the adoption of blockchain won’t make the world a perfect place.
Why the silence?
Lately, the hype around blockchain has quieted.
Some banks even decided to leave the R3 blockchain consortium after joining with great fanfare in autumn 2016.
Does that mean the hype is done?
Is blockchain, like Pokémon Go and “neural network” photo filter apps, dead to the media?
Actually, quite the contrary.
Those who have quieted down were the loudest supporters of the technology — the true believers and the frauds.
Meanwhile, some major companies such as IBM have developed dozens of prototypes and are starting to work on beta versions.
Those solutions are intended for the applications we described above — freight, certification of deals, real estate, business correspondence, document exchange, and more.
In this case, it’s quite clear which problems these solutions are designed for and whether they have profit potential.
They do not need to brag: The work is being done, and this looks like just the calm before the storm.
Bank of Canada and its partners created project Jasper to test blockchain.
Of course, not a lot of details are available, but some curious findings are known.
It was found the system would not work without a central bank, because standards must be applicable to everything in their sphere, even blockchain.
Which raises a tricky question: How many verifiers (miners) should there be, and who can be entrusted with access to the blocks?
In addition to trials, a couple of attempts have been made to demonstrate blockchain support as a token of a product’s “innovation.”
However, no one has ever succeeded turning a dog into a mermaid by attaching a fish tail to its body.
Blockchain is another key technology suffering from too much PR.
We’ve seen that happen with any number of technologies: cloud, P2P, and big data, to name a few.
First come the overexcited fanatics screaming with delight.
But then — zap!
— a technology becomes ubiquitous, although not usually in the way it was initially advertised.
Blockchain is about to make its way into many enterprises and verticals in the form of so-called private blockchains.
It’ll be some time before the private blockchains start interacting with each other.
A bit.
The rapid growth in the use of applications has significantly added to the digital clutter that exists on people’s digital devices: for example, users typically install 12 Android apps every month but delete only 10, in effect adding two apps to their device on a monthly basis.
As a result, some apps are left unused and idle on digital devices: On computers, at least 30% of installed applications are never used.
The danger is that apps remain active even though the user is not using them: on average users have 66 apps on their Android device, but an experiment which installed a representative sample of 66 of the most popular Android apps, found that 54 of them consumed 22Mb of traffic per day without a user even interacting with them.
Poor user maintenance of device content also generates a build-up of digital clutter: although in 55% of cases people regularly revise the contents of their device and delete unused docs and apps, in 32% of cases people only do this occasionally and in 13% of cases they try not to delete any docs and apps at all.
Improper app hygiene extends to managing apps: the survey found that 65% of users update apps on their smartphones as soon as they are released, but 24% only do so when they are forced to.
Moreover, only 40% intentionally adjust apps settings of each application on smartphone.
This can be a problem because apps have access to user sensitive information: 96 in 100 Android apps start working without users launching them, and 83 in 100 have access to sensitive user data such as accounts, contacts, messages, calls, files stored etc.
Some of the major problems that result from digital data overload are an increase in intrusive and unsolicited ads that often use vulnerabilities to penetrate the device: this was cited by survey respondents as a problem on smartphones (61%), tablets (47%) and for computers (55%).
Other prominent threats highlighted were devices developing glitches (38% on smartphone) or a malware infection (28% on computers).
This digital clutter and careless user behaviour is leaving devices — and the sensitive information they contain — vulnerable to security threats: our survey reveals that over half (56%) of users have lost data on their smartphone, over a third (39%) on tablets and 51% on computers.
Introduction
The digital age has created a mountain of digital clutter, and the explosion in the use of applications means that an increasing amount of information is saved on smartphones, tablets and personal computer devices.
Whereas, once upon a time, users quickly reached the storage capacity of their phone and had to make space available for new data, today capacity is less of an issue so people take five photos instead of one, “just to be sure”.
More space and power equals more data and apps.
Personal and sensitive information, such as address book contacts, text messages, videos and photos, now clutter our digital world, but failure to look after this information is putting it at risk.
As much as in the physical world, users need to take the cleaning of their digital ‘home’ more seriously.
Just like a clean, uncluttered room breathes fresh energy into your home and life, in the same way, an uncluttered computer or smartphone results in a more enjoyable and productive experience.
Digital clutter is a phenomenon that is the result of poor user device maintenance.
Maybe because users no longer have to worry about storage limits, they’ve become lethargic about reviewing and protecting their devices and updating the apps.
This means that, increasingly, our digital junk sits on our devices or in the cloud in perpetuity.
The problem is that the more we accumulate digitally, the more people open up their device to security threats that risk sensitive data, such as passport and credit card information, falling into the wrong hands.
That’s why users should take time to update and delete unused apps for the essential care of their device.
The purpose of this study is to find out the extent to which users are drowning in digital clutter.
We aim to reveal what problems this causes users and offer some useful advice on what can be done to improve the security and safety of sensitive information.
Methodology
This study is based on insight gained from a unique combination of online research and technical analysis of security threats and app performance:
Statistics from the Kaspersky Security Network, a cloud-based system that processes depersonalized cyberthreat-related statistics received from millions of Windows and Android devices owned by Kaspersky Lab users across the globe.
A real-life experiment on Android devices that analyzed the performance of applications was conducted in January 2017 by Kaspersky Lab internal testers.
An online survey conducted by research firm Toluna and Kaspersky Lab in January 2017 assessed the attitudes of 16,250 users aged over 16 years old from 17 countries.
My Precious Data: online survey geography
Not all the results from each study have been included in this report.

Information overload
These days our devices are used as storage for all aspects of our digital lives.
Users tend to save everything, even things that they know, deep down, they’ll never need or be able to find.
This type of data is a major contributor to unnecessary clutter on our devices.
But unlike clutter in the real world — where stacks of papers, books, clothing and other assorted junk can be physically seen — there are no obvious outward signs that could indicate a problem.
Our global online survey shows that a large majority of people store a wide range of information on their devices.
Overall, the most common items stored on digital devices are general photos and videos for nine in ten (90%) of respondents.
This is closely followed by personal emails (89%) and photos and videos of travel (89%), address book information (84%) and personal text or messages (79%).
We found that in almost two thirds (62%) of cases users have their passwords, including auto-login for websites and apps, stored on their devices.
More than half also store financial and payment information (62%), or scans of their passports, driver’s licenses, insurance certificates and other sensitive documents (57%).
We see differences from country to country.
For example, scans of sensitive documents are particularly popular for users in the UAE (87%) compared to Japan (32%).
Similarly, the storage of private and sensitive photos and videos is less big in Europe (48%), than in Russia (67%).
In the face of this ever-increasing mountain of data, we set about understanding how often users tend to wipe data and apps from their devices.
Overall, the survey found that in only 55% of cases users said they regularly revise the contents of their device and delete everything they haven’t used in a long time, and in a third of cases (32%) users said they do this occasionally, for example, when they don’t have any more space available.
Worryingly, in one-in-ten (13%) cases people said they never delete anything.
Attitudes to app data
A few years ago it would have been hard to predict the rapidly exploding app industry, but there’s no sign of any slowdown in its growth yet.
Apps are available for all areas of digital life, from fitness trackers to productivity tools, and from travel planners to social media.
The apps and the data they accumulate leads to digital clutter that can rob phones of performance, decrease available storage space and put users at risk of security threats.
Different pieces of research conducted by Kaspersky Lab show that the apps and programs used vary according to device.
Generally, and perhaps unsurprisingly, we see that PCs are mostly used for work, tablets for entertainment and smartphones for communication.
Moreover, in our survey we see that the build-up of digital clutter is most acute on the device we carry around with us all day — the smartphone.
Smartphones are the devices that typically have many apps that contain the most sensitive user data, such as contactless payment information or private photos and personal messaging.
Applications installed on user devices:
My Precious Data: Applications installed on user devices
However, we can reveal that large groups of users fail to undertake the basic procedures for keeping this device clutter-free and therefore less vulnerable to security threats.
Research based on data from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) shows that, on average, users have 66 apps installed on their Android device.
However, in the survey users say they only have 15 which perhaps suggests that users aren’t aware of the number of apps, and therefore the volume of data, they carry around with them.
We see that, on average, users typically install 12 apps on their Android devices every month but delete only 10, in effect adding two apps to their device on a monthly basis.
With users adding more apps and more data to their devices every month, attitudes to app cleansing are important in order to combat the problem of digital clutter.
The survey showed that although three quarters of users (77%) have deleted a smartphone app within month period, 12% don’t remember when they last deleted one.
The smartphone is the device that is cleaned most often: for example, 26% of users do not remember when they last deleted an app from their computers.
People probably clean smartphones more often because there is less space available: 35% deleted an app from a smartphone because there was no more space, compared to just 13% on computers.
This point is supported by KSN research that shows computer applications are often redundant on the machine.
We found that people never use at least a third (30%) of applications installed on their computers over a six-month period (excluding drivers, runtime software and other programs users do not work with directly).
Best practice for the general maintenance of applications installed on devices requires people to understand user agreements and adjust the settings for apps.
However, we found that only a third (32%) of respondents read agreements carefully and are able to decline installation of the app on their smartphone if they are not satisfied.
This is important because apps have access to a lot of sensitive information on devices.
Furthermore, the survey found that under half (40%) intentionally adjust the settings of each application on their smartphone.
This is particularly popular in the US (48%), UAE (46%) and Asia-Pacific (44%) rather than in Israel (26%), Japan (33%) and Russia (36%).
App settings enable the user to manage how the app interacts with the device.
For example, apps can get access to user sensitive information, track user locations and share user data with third party servers.
Failure to manage these settings can result in unused apps gaining access to information on the device without the user being aware.
The issue of app cleansing and maintenance is important because, for the smartphone in particular, they contain the most sensitive data and are constantly with us.
Improperly managed smartphone apps also represent a security threat because they often transmit data even when they’re not being used.
Kaspersky Lab set up an experiment to test how the world’s top Android apps, defined by KSN statistics, behave in a variety of circumstances.
We downloaded 66 apps (the average number of apps installed on one Android device) selected according to popularity.
These top 66 apps in total took up about 5GB of storage.
The devices were formatted, fitted with SIM cards and restarted, connected to the mobile Internet and with Wi-Fi set-up.
None of the third-party applications were launched by testers and we recorded figures for the data usage of each application.
Of the top 66, only 12 applications didn’t have any traffic consumption.
But interestingly, on average, the remaining 54 run without user consent consuming 22Mb of traffic per day without a user even interacting with the apps.
The resulting impact on the device includes issues with performance and battery life.
This is backed up by the technical findings of the KSN research.
Analysis shows that of 100 Android apps that users can manage through installing, deleting or updating, 96 start working without users actually launching them manually.
Furthermore, 83 in 100 have access to user sensitive data, such as contacts, files and messages, and can even make calls and send SMSs.
This is a tempting prospect for cybercriminals looking to exploit sensitive data.
My Precious Data: The secret life of apps
These findings highlight the importance of managing and deleting unused apps, because they are often working in the background, even if the user is not aware of it.
It is important for users to update apps as soon as new versions are released because they might include security patches that prevent or reduce vulnerabilities in the app.
We found that 65% of users update apps on their smartphone as soon as they are released, while a quarter (24%) only do this when they are forced to.
The trend for updating apps as soon as they’re launched was found to be particularly strong in the UAE (78%) and Latin America (68%), when compared to Russia (55%).
In contrast, computer users are less likely to update apps.
48% of users update apps as soon as possible, 30% do this only when they are forced to, and 12% try not to update apps on their PCs at all.
According to KSN stats, no more than half of users install updates for the most exploited software (such as pdf readers, browsers, etc.) on their computers during the week after these updates are released.
The most popular apps on the app stores issue updates that will often include relevant bug fixes as frequently as weekly, while other release cycles may happen every few months.
In fact, Kaspersky Lab’s study into app usage revealed that, on average, the most popular 300 Android apps are updated every 45 days.
However, we also show that 88 apps from this list are never updated, leaving them — and their users — at risk of exploitation by cybercriminals.
This is risky, because apps that are not updated are doors for malware to exploit vulnerabilities in the apps and OS as a means of penetrating the device.
In 2016, four million exploits were detected, which is 16% more than in 2015.
Overall, in the last year Kaspersky Lab’s solutions combated 758,044,650 attacks on Internet users around the world, and many such attacks were using vulnerabilities in software and OS.
Problems with data ‘obesity’
The phrase data obesity has been coined in recent years to describe the way users clutter digital devices with excess information.
The analogy implies that you may be continually snacking on new information which may provide very little value in your life — and then creating a number of problems by storing all that nutrition-less information on your devices.
Users exhibit careless behaviour towards the hygiene of their devices despite the fact that we found fears over personal data loss are well founded across all digital devices.
Our survey reveals that 56% of users have lost data on their smartphone, 39% on tablets and 51% on computers.
In most of these cases, data was deleted because of a damaged device or a user accidentally deleted it, and the third most common reason was malware infection.
For example, in the case of smartphones, we found 73% of those in the Asian-Pacific region have lost data in contrast to 44% in Europe.
A wide range of other problems associated with digital data overload are also highlighted in the study.
For example, the main problem with devices cited by respondents was intrusive and unsolicited ads, for smartphones (61%), tablets (47%) and for computers (55%).
These ads often use vulnerabilities to penetrate the device, and in 2016 the most popular and dangerous mobile Trojans were advertising Trojans that can obtain superuser rights on the device.
Users highlighted problems with battery life, lack of memory and unsolicited ads on smartphones more often than on tablets and computers.
This is caused by poor device maintenance and happens when users fail to delete apps and update them, opening the device up to security threats.
At the same time, computers faced glitches and malware more than smartphones and tablets.
Conclusion
This report demonstrates the scale of the problem with the data that permeates across all the devices that help us to manage our digital lives.
Digital clutter is increasing and so are user problems associated with it.
User behaviour and attitudes to applications are the source of many of these issues.
Many users fail to undertake the simple but essential care of their device that cleans and updates software and apps, adjusts settings and uninstalls unused apps.
These actions are important to the hygiene of devices and the data that exists on it — from phone through to tablet and computer.
Just as it’s become traditional to clean out our closets, attics, and garages each spring, it’s good practice to regularly clear out and refresh digital spaces.
It keeps them running smoothly and protects security, so spending a little time to get your digital house in order could prevent you from losing important or sensitive information in the future.
With time, we’ve unknowingly accumulated mountains of unwanted data that could leave us exposed to ever-increasing cybersecurity threats.
The digital world is growing and so is our capacity to store this data.
But the fact that we have the capability to store vast information doesn’t mean we should.
Frank Schwab, Professor in Media Psychology at the University Wuerzburg, says that because users don’t understand the risks associated with digital clutter, they don’t invest the time in good device and app maintenance.
He said: “People tend to be irrational in evaluating risk in everyday life — in both directions.
Rational decisions require a very conscious mental act, and this also applies when dealing with digital devices.
It is exhausting and requires effort, so we need to invest in it and in many cases we are simply too lazy to do so.”
Frank Schwab continued: “Cyberthreats, in addition, are such that most of us cannot understand how they work, they do not produce dramatic images and they are hardly ever the topic of everyday conversation.
For our emotional functioning, which is based on simple rules and experiences, there is no reason to change behavior, as the feeling of threat is extremely low.
This means that investing time in keeping our devices clean is psychologically not relevant to us, as we don’t feel any consequences from extensive data clutter.”
Users are advised to take action to clear the clutter from their phone, tablet and computer with the following steps:
Complete an audit — ensure you know what information is stored where.
This will help you to clean devices more easily and give you peace of mind that your data is secure.
Clean your device — once you know where everything is stored, it is easy to delete unused and unwanted files and apps that may pose a risk to your device.
Update software — regular updates should be undertaken as soon as new versions are released.
Use dedicated software — software cleaners such as the one integrated into Kaspersky Lab’s flagship security solutions, scan all applications installed on your device and mark those posing potential risk or those that are rarely used.
It will also inform the user if the application slows down the user’s device, provides incomplete/incorrect information about its functions, operates in the background, and shows banners and messages without permission (e.g., advertising).
Kaspersky Lab’s flagship security solution for home users also contains an Application Manager feature that sends alerts if a program has been installed without their awareness or clear consent, for example, as additional software during the installation of another application.

One day in May 2016, Marion, a computer user from Germany, logged on to her home computer.
She had no idea what lay in store for her.
The first sign of trouble was when her computer did not boot up normally, and she couldn’t get to the desktop.
Even after a restart, nothing changed.
Then she saw the ransomware message on her screen.
She hadn’t spotted anything suspicious the last time she, or any other member of her family, had used the computer.
CryptXXX v3 ransom note
The rise of ransomware
Ransomware has been a growing problem for the past few years, and it shows no sign of slowing down.
We all know that it’s important to make backups on a regular basis, not to open suspicious e-mails, to use the best security software, and so on.
But still, anything can happen, and then you suddenly find yourself with inaccessible data on your PC, network shares, and attached hard drives.
You can’t make your PC 100% safe unless you disconnect it from any network, remove the CD drive, USB connections, and more.
This is rarely practical in today’s connected world.
So it’s time to get involved in risk management: to find your own personal balance of convenience, safety, and privacy.
And, if you should become a victim of a ransomware attack, you need to know that your decision isn’t a simple binary — to pay or not to pay.
Attackers are fixing the “bugs” that used to allow companies such as Kaspersky Lab and its partners to develop generic tools to decrypt files hit by various ransomware threats.
Today, ever more variants of increasingly sophisticated ransomware exist, and recovery often requires private keys from the criminals.
As her day got gradually worse, Marion turned off her computer and asked the IT department at work for help.
They were able to capture all of the relevant data: the ransomware message, the related files on disk, and even some pictures and PDFs before and after encryption.
They tried all available tools to decrypt the files, but none worked.
No More Ransom saves the day
At that point, the full impact of what had happened to her PC hit Marion.
Her hard drive contained an archive with more than a decade’s worth of family pictures on it: years of special occasions, sorted into folders and organized by date.
Marion did not have an external backup, but she was sure of one thing: She was not going to pay any money to the criminals.
In this way she got some of them back.
But the majority remained lost.
With the help of her employer’s IT department, she looked online but couldn’t find a solution.
Finally, as a last resort, she put a post on Facebook asking for help and even offered a €500 reward to anyone who could help her to get her files back without paying the criminals!
(Translation: Though I received many hints from various helping hands, my files remain encrypted.
Looks like I got hit by a new variant.
But I won't give up the hope and raise the bounty to 500 euros for anyone who can help to decrypt my files.)
(Translation: Though I received many hints from various helping hands, my files remain encrypted.
Looks like I got hit by a new variant.
But I won’t give up the hope and raise the bounty to 500 euros for anyone who can help to decrypt my files.)
About 20 people replied to her post and tried to help.
However, none of them succeeded.
A former schoolmate of mine spotted Marion’s post and, knowing that my job is on the GReAT team at Kaspersky Lab, added me to the conversation.
I got in touch with Marion, and she provided all the relevant information so I could check for tools to decrypt her files.
But I couldn’t find any for the particular variant that had hit her.
With Marion’s information in hand, I asked our ransomware specialists for help.
They quickly confirmed that the malware was a new variant of CryptXXX V3 and that the specific tools to help her decrypt her files were not yet available.
I relayed the bad news to Marion but advised her not to pay the ransom — as attackers create new ransomware, we are working with law enforcement and other partners to develop decryption tools or to extract the private keys stored by criminals on their command-and-control servers.
We do this through the No More Ransom project.
In the summer of 2016, Europol, Kaspersky Lab, and Intel Security launched the NoMoreRansom.org portal to help ransomware victims recover their files, and to help disrupt the lucrative business model that keeps cybercriminals coming back for more.
The project now has more than 40 partners.
On the 20th of December, we added another decryptor for CryptXXX V3 to the No More Ransom page.
We offer it free of charge, like all of the ransomware tools you’ll find there.
I still had Marion’s case in my mind, so I contacted her on Facebook and pointed her to the new tool.
(Naturally, I wouldn’t take the reward.)
I asked Marion what she had learned from this incident.
Besides doing regular backups of her data to different external hard drives, she’s now even more careful while surfing the Web and always makes sure she has the latest patches installed.
And she also stopped letting anyone else use her PC.
This takes the story back to the need for us all to be our own risk managers.
Ultimately, it’s up to you to look after your PC, network, privacy, and personal assets.
NoMoreRansom.org should be the first place to check — you could get your files back without having to pay anyone a cent.
Even if the solution for you doesn’t exist yet, give it some time and don’t pay the crooks.
Marion is just one of many beneficiaries of the No More Ransom project, which has so far released seven free decryption tools.
Five thousand users have unlocked their files, and saved more than $1.5 million in ransom, with its help.

We’ve already posted about Eugene Kaspersky and about a hundred other people being on their way to the Antarctic.
Well, neither Eugene nor his travel companions do such things on a regular basis, so you have to figure there’s a reason behind it.
The Antarctic Biennale: Cybersecurity meets science and art
The Antarctic Biennale Expedition brings together approximately 100 participants — artists, researchers, and visionaries from all over the world — to explore and to think about a universal cultural future for Antarctica as a model of other “shared spaces” such as Ocean and Outer Space.
The art expedition started in Ushuaia, our planet’s southernmost city.
Alexander Ponomarev, artist, philosopher, and the project’s leader, believes the journey will be “a revolution that changes the vector.”
The core idea: a paradigm shift for the artists.
Drop the usual pavilions of the typical galleries in favor of the icy inaccessibility of the Antarctic.
Lose the comfortable apartments in favor of ascetic ship cabins.
Antarctic scenery and lots of talks with technical people are also outside of the norm for artists.
Each passenger on the ship can take part in discussions, poetry, and philosophy workshops as well as start designing the future in the Antarctic Biennale Vision club.
But the most important thing is that each expedition member will be an eyewitness and contributor to the art-making process.
Why is Kaspersky Lab sponsoring such an event?
Antarctica does not seem obviously relevant to the field of cybersecurity.
But we believe in creative people and creative decisions — be they business choices or the projects that we support.
Artists and scientists from all over the world will fulfill their most daring ideas in the remotest land on Earth.
The age of discovery was about geographical exploration, and the Biennale’s journey of discovery will be about opening the doors to cross-cultural encounters and communication, which aims to positively influence international cooperation.
Joint work developed by all participants will once again prove that collaboration and coexistence work better than tension and mistrust.
Eugene Kaspersky loves both art and expeditions.
It’s no surprise he’s on board of the Antarctic Biennale ship as well.
Actually, beyond the sponsorship, we’ve contributed to the project in a special way: our mission to save the world has inspired an Argentinean artist and engineer Joaquín Fargas to create the Glaciator.
We’re still aiming to save the world from viruses, but the Glaciator will target very, very old ones.
This robot will save the world by compressing snow.
We're still aiming to save the world from viruses, but the Glaciator will target very, very old ones.
This robot will save the world by compressing snow.
Here is some background: Since 2003, viruses have been found buried in permafrost, a layer of soil in the Antarctic that is usually permanently frozen (hence the name).
Rising temperatures and melting ice could result in the reappearance of ancient deadly viruses.
And it looks like all kinds of infection-causing viruses could defrost as the world warms — and, as you probably know, it is getting warmer and warmer.
So, Kaspersky Lab is sending a robot to keep the Earth safe from viruses — this time not in cyberspace, but in Antarctica.
The Glaciator compresses snow as it steps on it.
The robot is a “Firn-Maker.”
Firn is an intermediate state between snow and glacier ice.
Making firn accelerates the formation of a glacier.
And although we believe that being physically disconnected from the Internet makes Antarctica one of the safest places on Earth in terms of cybersecurity, we are not leaving anything to chance: Glaciator is protected by security software from Kaspersky Lab.
The Antarctic Biennale has just begun — the expedition has left the harbor and just crossed the Antarctic Circle.
It’s not easy to work on the ship.
While passing through the Drake Passage on the first day, some of the artists started suffering from seasickness, so schedules had to be rearranged.
Hey, nobody said it would be easy — and that’s part of the idea.
The sea is unusually calm, though, so there is hope that the situation will improve when the participants get their sea legs.
On March 20, the expedition crossed the South Polar Circle, meeting foggy, windy, and very humid weather — and its first icebergs.
That was also the first day back on land, and troubled stomachs unclenched a bit.
A long journey awaits.
The ship will harbor near several islands, and then the crew will set foot on the soil of the Antarctic continent.
After that, the ship will head to Cape Horn, and only then will it return to Argentina.
Of course the participants are taking a lot of pictures, so despite some data and bandwidth restrictions, we decided to live blog the expedition.

Modern smartphones have way more memory than desktop computers had a decade ago.
Out of space?
Why bother deleting anything when you can just replace your old 64GB memory card with new shiny 128GB card?
It doesn’t exactly cost a fortune.
The secret life of apps
For the most part, inexpensive storage is a good thing, but there’s a downside: With so much space, we don’t care anymore how many files and programs we store in our devices’ memory.
According to our research, on average, modern Android users have 66 apps installed on their smartphones or tablets.
Moreover, we typically install about a dozen new apps every month but delete only ten, effectively increasing the overall count by two every month.
The real problem is that you can’t control what all of those apps are doing.
According to Kaspersky Security Network data, 96 out of 100 Android apps start working without users launching them.
And 83 out of 100 apps have access to sensitive user data such as contacts, messages, calls history, files in storage, and so on.
We set up an experiment to check how the world’s top apps behave.
Of the 66 apps, 54 were running and consuming 22MB of data allowance per day — without the user even interacting with them.
Android operating system actually provides the ability to fine-tune data that apps can access.
It’s called the app permissions system.
However, people mostly ignore this powerful tool: only 40% of users always adjust permissions settings for every app.
Another issue with keeping a lot of unnecessary apps is vulnerabilities.
In general, people are not good about updating the programs installed on their devices: Only 65% of users update apps on their smartphones as soon as the newer versions are released, and 24% do so only when they are forced to.
The more apps you have, the less likely you are to update all of them right away — despite all Google’s efforts, updating still takes time and requires some clicking through.
And it’s not only users who are guilty of carelessness; developers are as well.
Our research shows that 88 of world’s top 300 Android apps are never updated, leaving users at risk of exploitation by cybercriminals.
All in all, you need to tend to your herd of apps.
Regarding that, we have some advice:
Don’t install tons of apps just for the sake of it.
Before downloading a new app from Google Play, think for a moment — do you really need this app?
Delete apps that you no longer use.
Get into the habit of cleaning up your installed apps list, say, on a monthly basis.
OK, let’s be realistic: Do it at least every couple of months.
Newer versions often include security fixes.
Google Play has a nice autoupdate feature for all apps that are downloaded from it.
It’s a handy feature, and we recommend using it.
Adjust app permissions settings.
It’s important to keep an eye on which apps have access to which sensitive data.
Here we have a thorough guide on Android permissions.
I doesn’t hurt to have a security app — antivirus for Android — that helps you check if any of those dozens of apps you install are malicious.
It’s the small things in life — delicious tea in your favorite mug, comfortable shoes, a flower on the window seat, and … the Kaspersky Protection browser extension.
We’ve already discussed its main functions: protecting your passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data from leakage, as well as keeping you from stumbling into malicious websites.
However, this small program has a few other useful features.
Tip of the week: Browser extension features
Kaspersky Protection is a part of Kaspersky Internet Security and Kaspersky Total Security.
It is installed automatically into Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, after which your browser will ask you if you want to enable the extension.
In addition to the aforementioned features, Kaspersky Protection provides quick access to special modules that block annoying advertising banners, hide your private information from data mining services, or open the on-screen keyboard with a single click.
If you removed the Kaspersky Protection extension but want to bring it back now, follow the directions here.
The screen below shows how to turn on Anti-Banner and thereby remove annoying ads from Web pages.

Here you can see how to set up protection from data mining.
Once you’ve done that, websites and online advertising agencies will not be able to gather your personal information to make a profile of you and use it for marketing purposes.
Here you can see how to set up protection from data mining.
Finally, here is how you can quickly open the On-Screen Keyboard with the help of Kaspersky Protection.
The on-screen keyboard comes in handy when you have to enter sensitive financial data — it won’t let keyloggers steal your info.

Password management is one of the most essential and yet probably the most annoying of security measures.
Short passwords are easy to remember, but they’re insecure; long and strong passwords are hard to remember — especially if you’re using unique ones, as you should do if you value security.
When it comes to smartphones, passwords are even more painful: strong and unique passwords are not only hard to remember, they’re actually hard to type with the tiny on-screen keypads of mobile devices.
Well, we have an easy solution for all these problems.
Password Manager makes life much easier: Instead of memorizing dozens of passwords for this or that service, all you need to remember is a master password.
Actually, you don’t have to enter even this password every time you log in to Kaspersky Password Manager: Our app supports Touch ID.
So all you need to do is to touch your fingerprint sensor — on a Mac, an iPad, or an iPhone.
Get rid of 123456 and duplicate passwords in a couple of clicks
Here’s another good thing about our Password Manager: You can use it to check if your passwords are good enough.
Just click the Check Password Security button and the app will show you which passwords are good and which ones need some work.
Kaspersky Password Manager: Check password security
If you find it hard to invent strong passwords yourself, use the Generate Password button, which, you guessed it, brings up a random password generator.
By default it makes 12-character-long passwords that include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Kaspersky Password Manager: Secure password generator
No more torture by on-screen keyboard
Kaspersky Password Manager is a cloud-based app.
That means you don’t need to suffer typing in your long and complex passwords with those tiny on-screen keyboard keys — not even once, to set it up.
All you need to do is to install Password Manager on both your laptop or desktop and your smartphone, and use the bigger and more comfortable keyboard to input the passwords you want to store.
Everything will be synced instantly across your devices.
Moreover, you can access and edit your password list using our website My.Kaspersky.com.
It’s a little bit less convenient than using the desktop app, but it’s a lifesaver when you’re away from your own computer.
Needless to say, all your passwords are stored encrypted, both on your devices and in the cloud.
Last, but not least: You can use the basic version of Kaspersky Password Manager free of charge.
Here are download links for the macOS app and the iOS app.
Google said more than half of Android devices haven’t received a security update in the past year, and the percentage of potentially harmful apps running on devices installed from all sources rose in 2016.
The numbers come from the Android Security 2016 Year In Review (PDF) released Wednesday.
While the reports touts security gains made over the last year, it also highlights areas where security is lacking.
March 14, 2017 , 3:40 pm
March 13, 2017 , 2:01 pm
By Q4 2016, Google said half of all Android devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year.
This past year was the first full year of Google’s monthly patches.
Google said overall the number of potentially harmful apps (PHA) downloaded from Google Play and including third-party apps stores running on Android devices rose to 0.71 percent in 2016, up from 0.5 percent in 2015 (PDF).
“Still, there’s more work to do for devices overall, especially those that install apps from multiple sources,” wrote co-authors of the report Adrian Ludwig, Google’s Director of Android Security, and Mel Miller, an Android security team member.
“Using improved tools and the knowledge we gained in 2016, we think we can reduce the number of devices affected by PHAs in 2017, no matter where people get their apps.”
On a positive note, in 2016 Google reported, on average, devices that only installed applications from Google Play had less than 0.05 percent of PHAs installed.
In 2015, that number was 0.15 percent.
Google said, during the past year it managed the security of 1.4 billion Android user devices.
In that timeframe, Google touted its work with wireless carriers, system on chip manufacturers and device makers to release security patches at a faster pace.
“Several manufacturers, including Samsung, LG and OnePlus, regularly deliver security updates to flagship devices on the same day as Google’s updates to Nexus and Pixel devices, thereby providing their customers with the most up-to-date security available,” according to Google.
Still, over the past year, security experts pointed to device patching as a major issue for Google in 2016 and the year ahead.
This past August, Google’s patching of the high-profile QuadRooter vulnerability took 96 days for it to go from vulnerability notification by Qualcomm to the release of the final patch for the critical flaws on Sept. 6.
Rich Smith, director of research and development for Duo Labs, blames carriers and manufacturers for hurting Google’s ability to speedily deploy patches.
“(They) are doing a much worse job and acting as a drag factor on the overall Android ecosystem when it comes to timely patching,” he said.
By Q4 2016, more than half of the top 50 Android devices worldwide had a “recent” security patch, Google said.
Smith points out that “recent” is a relative term.
“Our analysis suggests that ‘recent’ looks to be about 90 days,” he said.
Duo Labs analysis of one million enterprise Android devices shows 65 percent of Google’s own Nexus and Pixel hardware receive security patches within a 60-day window of being released.
And that 36 percent of what Google classifies as “top 50” Android devices receive a security patch within the first 60 days of availability.
After three months, 90 percent of Google’s own devices had patches compared to 81 percent of other “top 50” Android devices, according to Duo Labs.
“That number is pretty impressive when you consider the fact that devices that aren’t part of the Nexus or Pixel family are at the mercy of their OEM or carrier as to when (or if) they would receive these updates,” Smith said.
Mediaserver, Google noted in its report, also received a big update in 2016.
It was Android’s mediaserver, coupled with a security hole in Qualcomm’s Secure Execution Environment, which exposed 60 percent of Android devices to attack in 2016 as part of the QuadRooter vulnerability.
“We re-architected the mediaserver stack to address Stagefright-type vulnerabilities by adding integer overflow protections and compartmentalizing mediaserver’s components into individual sandboxes with minimal privileges.
We also increased the degree of randomness in address space layout randomization (ASLR), making some attacks more difficult,” Google said.
“The overall health of Google Play has increased year over year.
The number of installed trojans dropped by 51.5 percent, hostile downloaders dropped by 54.6 percent, backdoors dropped by 30.5 percent, and phishing apps dropped by 73 percent,” wrote Ludwig and Miller.
A report on ransomware sheds new light on attacks in 2016, starting with the fact that 48 percent of businesses hit by ransomware said they paid the ransom.
That’s in spite of pleas from cyber security experts and the FBI not to do so.
Other insights include the average ransom payment was $2,500 with 7 percent of respondents admitting to paying more than $10,000 to get their data back.
The Ponemon Institute study, titled “The Rise of Ransomware” and sponsored by backup company Carbonite, found by far that most ransomware attacks stemmed from phishing and social engineering ploys.
Another 30 percent of respondents said they were lured in by insecure or spoofed websites.
March 22, 2017 , 3:38 pm
March 21, 2017 , 1:11 pm
“Fifty-eight percent of respondents say negligent employees put their company at risk for a ransomware attack,” the report said.
The study (PDF) was based on 618 respondents comprised mainly of IT contractors, managers and business owners reporting directly to a business CISO.
Data culled from these sources suggest ransomware worries will continue well into 2017.
Only a quarter of respondents expressed confidence that their current security would protect their company from future ransomware attacks.
“An average of one or more ransomware infections go undetected per month and are able to bypass their organization’s IPS and/or AV systems, according to 44 percent of respondents,” according to the study.
Trends such as the growth of Internet of Things and connected devices will increase the threat landscape, they said.
When it comes to the types of ransomware, 80 percent of survey respondents said they were hit by crypto ransomware and 20 percent of respondents say their company experienced locker ransomware, which prevents access to the computer until a ransom is paid.
Forty-six percent of victims were given fewer than two days to pay a ransom while 16 percent said attackers placed no time limit on paying the ransom.
Compromised data related to ransomware attacks is also a topic of great concern among its victims.
Of those attacked, more than half of victims are fairly sure that data was removed from compromised devices.
Obviously, the loss of confidential data is only one of many ransomware headaches businesses face.
Thirty-three percent of respondents said the top true cost of ransomware is having to invest in new security defenses.
Another 32 percent said the loss of revenue due to business downtime and also the loss of customers were both the biggest contributors to the economic impact of ransomware.
Much to the disappointment of the FBI, almost half (49 percent) of respondents said there were too afraid of public scrutiny to report ransomware attacks to law enforcement.
The FBI has been a loud advocate for ransomware victims to come forward, arguing “a Bitcoin wallet address, transaction data, the hashtag of the malware, or any email correspondence, it can help advance an FBI ransomware investigation.”
Despite those pleas from law enforcement, 17 percent of companies said they didn’t notify the authorities because they didn’t believe the ransom demand was exorbitant.
Another 10 percent said they were afraid going to the authorities out of fear it might motivate additional attacks.
The best way to avoid paying a ransom?
Backup your data and systems.
Of the 52 percent of respondents that said they were hit by a ransomware attack, but didn’t pay the ransom, they cited having a full backup as to why, according to the study.
InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), parent company to Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Kimpton Hotels and Resorts, confirmed on Friday a breach of payment card systems used in 12 of its hotels located in North America and the Caribbean.
According to IHG, which operates 5,000 hotels worldwide, malware was found on servers used to process credit cards.
The servers were infected between last August and December; the company declined to say how many payment cards were impacted.
Fileless Memory-Based Malware Plagues 140 Banks, Enterprises
February 8, 2017 , 4:37 pm
January 19, 2017 , 3:35 pm
In a statement released Friday, IHG said it found malware installed on servers used at popular destinations such as Michael Jordan’s Steak House and Bar in Chicago, the Holiday Inn San Francisco Fisherman’s Wharf, the Copper Lounge in Los Angeles, and the Palm Bar in Aruba.
A full list of locations impacted was posted by IHG.
The hotelier reported on Dec. 28 that it was investigating customer complaints of unauthorized charges on credit cards.
At the time, the company said only a limited number of destinations were impacted before revealing more details on Friday.
“Findings show that malware was installed on servers that processed payment cards used at restaurants and bars of 12 IHG managed properties,” according to a statement.
“Cards used at the front desk of these properties were not affected.”
According to IHG, the malware searched for magnetic stripe track data as it was being routed through servers.
Track data included cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code.
There is also no information provided on the strain of malware used in the attacks.
Hotels, restaurants and other hospitality outlets are frequently singled out as victims of opportunistic hackers.
Last year alone there were nearly a dozen reports of card breaches.
Similarly, malware was used to siphon payment card data.
The prevalence of malware use to steal payment card data hit a peak in 2014 when it was at the center of several high-profile breaches, including Target and Neiman Marcus.
As recently as last November, security researchers at Trustwave said the Carbanak cybercrime gang, first discovered by Kaspersky Lab, had shifted strategy and began targeting the hospitality and restaurant industries with new techniques and malware.
Part of the Carbanak tactics involved targeting hospitality call centers with elaborate ploys to get customer service representatives to accept and download emails with malicious macro-laced documents.
The target was credit card data scraped from the memory of point-of-sale systems.
“We have been working with the security firms to review our security measures, confirm that this issue has been remediated, and evaluate ways to enhance our security measures,” IHG wrote in a statement regarding the breach.
SAN FRANCISCO – Security researchers say a new trend in privateering is gaining traction among nation states, which are increasingly contracting with private companies to carry out state-sponsored attacks.
Typically APT attacks have been the work of  internal government spy apparatuses, but outsourcing allows nation states to shift risk, dodge attribution claims and take advantage of more sophisticated APT tools available on the black market, according to a report by Cybereason’s Intelligence Unit, released Tuesday at the RSA Conference.
March 6, 2017 , 2:27 pm
Bruce Schneier on IoT Regulation
Cybereason said China, Russia and United Arab Emirates are three of many countries that are increasingly outsourcing targeted operations to individual hacking groups and companies that range from established organizations, to ones created out of whole cloth for the sole purpose of an APT campaign.
“This trend has been slowly building over the last five years.
Over the last year to year-and-a-half, the number of operators in this space have grown large enough to merit an investigation,” said Ross Rustici, associate director, intelligence research, Cybereason.
Cybereason’s report singles out a number of Chinese firms as examples of a private company carrying out attacks on the behalf of China’s equivalent of the National Security Agency.
Threatpost attempted to contact China-based Bo Yu Guangzhou Information Technology which was named in the report and did not get responses in time for publication.
Given their relationship with government, these companies likely have tacit permission to operate against foreign entities as long as the activity doesn’t produce significant issues for the government,” the report states.
Having private firms spy for nation states isn’t new.
“This method, long used by Chinese human intelligence operators has transferred over into the cyber arena,” according to the report.
“In some ways, this is a very old story,” Rustici said.
“However, given the centrality of attribution in both state-level cyber interactions and in understanding private sector intrusions, we felt that this phenomenon merited further discussion.”
According to Cybereason’s analysis, these types of privatized state-sponsored APT campaigns have been successful at accomplishing low to mid-tier goals.
China, according to Cybereason, is leading the trend in APT outsourcing.
Unlike past reliance by China on it People’s Liberation Army (PLA) hacking unit, more recent attacks are being carried out by full-fledge independent China-based companies that typically offer security solutions as covers for their spying apparatus.
“One of the drivers appears to be the increasing nature of public attribution and the need for more clandestine, plausibly deniable, operations.
It is far easier to hire a group of outsiders and then arrest them if they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar than say a member of the military,” Rustici said.
Past APT attacks have outsourced pieces of a campaign, but few have farmed out the entire platform as they are now, said the report.
Private Chinese companies that align with the Ministry of State Security’s intelligence and security agency goals and targets, have been caught and identified, Cybereason said.
But none of those have ever been tied back to China’s MSS, said Cybereason.
“This demonstrates the significant advantage outsourcing has over indigenous capabilities, especially for organizations that have a significant risk, should they be exposed,” the report states.
Besides attribution, another driver of this trend is a reduction in the time and money required to find, develop, and build exploits and malware against specific hard systems, Cybereason reports.
“This means that there is an ever-increasing pool of highly talented and sophisticated hackers going after increasingly unique systems,” according to the report.
The U.S. government’s role in vulnerability disclosures is a vital part of our national security and should be codified in law, said a group of policy experts at a panel discussion last week at the RSA Conference.
The panelists argued that the government’s current process of vulnerability use and disclosure, called Vulnerability Equities Process (VEP), is voluntary and should be protected by law.
“With a new administration, there is concern it might wield its powers over the government’s security apparatus and that would include the VEP,” said Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution and former attorney for the National Security Agency.
“There is an appetite to put additional protections in place around the VEP so that it is protected from the discretions of the federal government.”
March 14, 2017 , 3:26 pm
VEP is a controversial process that resides in the NSA that determines whether the government should withhold or disclose information about computer security vulnerabilities.
Iterations of the VEP have existed in some form since 2008.
Its existence didn’t become widely known until 2016 when the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act in order to gain access to the VEP.
Ever since then, the VEP has been a lightning rod for government critics who have long claimed the process isn’t transparent enough and protects government security researchers whom critics claim stockpile discovered and purchased vulnerabilities for intelligence operations.
VEP criticism hit a high watermark in 2014 when the federal government was accused of having advanced knowledge of the Heartbeed bug and not warning the public.
That’s a claim the NSA denies.
According to panelist Heather West, a senior policy manager for Mozilla, the VEP may be imperfect, but it’s the best the U.S. has in terms of a government vulnerability disclosure policy.
“From our perspective, it’s time for this process to be codified in law,” West said.
“We need to make sure it continues to operate at the level it is today.”
She acknowledged there could be a lot more transparency and accountability in the process, but argues the framework that exists today for vulnerability disclosure by the U.S. government is the envy of the world and needs to be preserved.
What is known about the VEP comes from a heavily redacted document released in January 2016.
Briefly, it lays the groundwork for when the government should disclose a vulnerability.
It weighs many criteria for disclosure such as how likely is it that others will discover the vulnerability, how badly the vulnerability is needed to obtain intelligence, and what are the risks posed and the harm that could be done if the vulnerability is left unpatched.
“We need to move from what is an interagency agreement to substantiate VEP into law,” said Rob Knake senior fellow with The Council on Foreign Relations and Former Director for Cybersecurity Policy at the White House National Security Council.
“I think it’s time to put a legal framework around this process.
It’s something the intelligence industry and the software industry are looking for and we hope the administration is listening.”
Knake and other panelists said making VEP law would inspire trust in the vulnerability disclosure process by its skeptics.
He also said legal accountability would force the NSA to be more transparent in its VEP oversight.
Currently the VEP is an administrative policy, not law nor executive order.
“Right now there are no penalties for individuals to hold back information,” Knake said.
“If you’re concerned about accountability, then making VEP law offers a lot of fringe benefits from congressional oversight to individual accountability.”
Neil Jenkins director of the Enterprise Performance Management Office with the Department of Homeland Security, said the VEP processes was reinvigorated over the past few years by the Obama administration.
Its goal, he said, is responsible and speedy disclosure of vulnerabilities and working with the private sector on patching.
“It’s not in our national interest to build up a stockpile of vulnerabilities to hide behind for intelligence purposes.
Jenkins said, currently government researchers find 100 vulnerabilities a year with about two percent withheld from the VEP for intelligence purposes.
“In a small number of cases, where we do restrict dissemination of the vulnerability, we look at those vulnerabilities regularly and make a determination every three to six months as to whether to release them,” he said.
During the discussion, panelists mostly sidestepped thornier questions that came up such as whether the government’s vulnerability disclosure policies currently skewed toward offensive purposes versus defensive purposes.
However when it came to the hot-button issue of the government buying vulnerabilities, panelist Knake advocated a new approach.
“I’d like to see the U.S. government actively looking for more vulnerabilities and supporting the research community.
I also think they should push the vast majority of those vulnerabilities back to companies and only use vulnerabilities they need for a very short time,” he said.
Knake said by accelerating the pace of discovering and buying vulnerabilities and then disclosing them, it would raise the bar for security across the board.
“I love the notion of a beautiful virtuous cycle of finding vulnerabilities and patching them and then finding more,” Hennessey said.
“I wouldn’t hold your breath that will happen anytime soon.”
She argued cost of the strategy would be too high when it came to government vulnerability research.
She added the more often the U.S. government paid for vulnerabilities the higher it would drive the cost up in the market for vulnerabilities.
“That plan also doesn’t account for the fragility of intelligence.
It’s not so easy to replace one unknown vulnerability with another.
Whenever the government doesn’t have those vulnerabilities it makes their job even more difficult,” Hennessey said.
A a panel of security experts at the RSA Conference on Wednesday said there is a lack of agreement on a definition of cyberwarfare and of the tools used to fight them.
“Words matter and it’s important to have definitions.
But one of the challenges is the pace of innovation gets in front of doctrine and law.
Only a few years ago the notion of warfare in cyberspace would be akin to if something blows up or a digital Pearl Harbor.
But what we have seen over the years is that the future warfare between two enemies might be only the targeting of data, information or it might be financial based,” said panelist Oren Falkowitz, CEO and co-founder of Area 1 Security.
Bruce Schneier on IoT Regulation
Gary Brown, professor of cyber security at Marine Corps University said this dynamic presents a different context for cyberwarfare.
“As we go forward and as the lawyers debate what the traditional outlines of what cyber weaponry are, we are moving beyond the type of incident we had with Stuxnet.
Cyberwarfare involves the targeting of data or information,” Brown said.
Modern-day tactics when it comes to launching an attack, they say, are radically different than the grandfather of digital weapons Stuxnet used six years ago.
Today attacks can be launched between two nations without concrete knowledge of a direct assault or attribution as to who is behind them.
And the tactics used, by comparison to Stuxnet, are mundane, and could include something as rudimentary as an effective phishing attack, Falkowitz said.
“It’s important to define things in the field, not just for the many legal reasons, but because in this area we are still setting expectations between states.
One of the things that is important when it comes to international relations is making sure states understand what the other nation is trying to do.
We debate all the time did this act cross some threshold into an armed conflict.
So it’s important we have some shared understanding,” Brown said.
The traditional definitions put forth by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare written in 2012 have lost a bit relevancy when it comes to defining what cyberwarfare is today, Brown said.
Espionage, theft of data and attacks on financial institutions by unknown adversaries are aren’t acts of war, but become part of a cyber operation as one state fights another, said Roy Katmor, co-founder and CEO of enSilo.
In Israel, cyber attacks against an adversary are considered part of the cyber operations, Katmor said.
Instruments used in those cyber operations include what many considered tools of espionage, not strictly cyber weapons that attack physical assets, he said.
But identifying cyberwarfare and weapons is not just a game of semantics.
Panelists agree common definitions of what cyberwarfare is helps define the tools needed to fight them.
“There is not a great need for people to have these elaborate (hacking) toolkits.
Ninety-seven percent of all cyber incidents start with something as basic as a phishing attack,” Falkowitz said.
So how does that shape how one nation state wages cyberwarfare against another?
Today cyberwarfare is less about targeting “things” with weapons, and more about affecting and undermining systems, Falkowitz said.
The bonus of keeping attacks simple and effective, it makes the arduous task of assigning attribution to cyber weapons or assaults even more difficult.
An attack that uses a commodity malware with a generic power-shell command-and-control could be perpetrated by any number of criminal actors.
That makes it almost impossible to understand the intent of the attack as opposed to having a digital fingerprint traceable to a nation state attacker, Katmor said.
From the early days of the iPhone, the CIA has had an interest in compromising the flagship Apple mobile device, according to the latest WikiLeaks release of CIA documents.
Today’s Vault 7 Dark Matter release shows an unsurprising interest from the intelligence agency in tracking iPhone users, as well as capabilities in developing implants and exploits targeting Mac firmware running on Macbooks.
Cisco Warns of Critical Vulnerability Revealed in ‘Vault 7’ Data Dump
March 20, 2017 , 1:20 pm
The iPhone attack documentation for the CIA’s NightSkies tools describes a beacon dating back to 2008, purpose-built for factory iPhones, indicating the CIA’s ability to interdict the Apple supply chain and install this tool.
“Intelligence agencies used to put these beacons in someone’s car and track its radio signals.
Modern beacons infest iPhones and report over the internet the location of an iPhone and other information from the phone,” said WikiLeaks founder, exiled publisher Julian Assange, during a press conference aired over the WikiLeaks Periscope account.
“Noteworthy is that NightSkies reached version 1.2 in 2008, indicating that it was in the process of being developed for some time,” Assange said.
“It is expressly designed be physically installed on factory-fresh iPhones, not phones that are stolen and then have the malware implanted, but in an iPhone before you get it.”
A request for comment from Apple was not returned in time for publication.
Assange said the CIA’s Embedded Development Branch (EDB) is responsible for developing these tools, and the group’s documentation shows the agency’s interest in not only targeting iPhones and Macbooks, but also maintaining a persistent presence on those devices that would survive a reinstallation of the Apple operating system.
The release comes two weeks after the first Vault 7 release on March 7.
The initial batch of documents were dated between 2013 and 2016 and included documentation on compromises for all the major modern browsers, smartphones, Windows, macOS and Linux computers and smart televisions.
Cisco was the first vendor last Friday to warn its customers about a vulnerability affecting more than 300 of its routers and switches.
The company still has not patched the flaws.
Today’s dump of CIA documents shows how the agency concentrated on developing malware and exploits that would attack the firmware running on Macs and iPhones, specifically EFI and UEFI firmware.
The Sonic Screwdriver project, for example, is an exploit that targets peripherals and executes as a Mac boots up, bypassing the protection afforded by an Apple Firmware Password, which prevents alterations of the boot path.
“The code for the Sonic Screwdriver is stored on the firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter,” the documentation states.
“The implant code will scan all internal and external media for a device with a specific volume name.”
Once the volume is found on a USB, CD or hard drive, it will execute a UEFI boot of that device.
The documentation also describes an implant called DarkSeaSkies, an EFI implant for Macbook Air laptops that includes the DarkMatter EFI implant, a kernel-space implant called SeaPea, and the NightSkies beacon/implant.
Another manual describing an implant called Triton for MacOS X machines and an EFI-persistent implant called DerStarke were also part of today’s dump.
DerStarke dates back to 2013, but Assange said that the CIA continued to update these tools through last year and has begun work on version 2.0.
Assange said that WikiLeaks reached out to the technology vendors impacted in the first Vault 7 dump, contacting on March 12 Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla and others.
Assange said Cisco was proactive in reaching out to WikiLeaks for information, and that no exploits were shared with Cisco, but that the description in the March 7 dump was enough for Cisco to work out the issue.
Mozilla, meanwhile, responded on March 12 and Assange said it agreed to WikiLeaks’ disclosure terms which match industry standards that include a 90-day disclosure deadline, and secure points of contact that include encryption keys.
MikroTik, a manufacturer of VoIP controllers targeted by the CIA replied similarly on March 15, but Google and Microsoft, which both replied March 20, pointed WikiLeaks instead to their respective disclosure terms, Assange said.
Problems with hardcoded credentials are hitting consumer IoT devices, industrial SCADA devices, and even critical infrastructure.
Despite the appeal on source code and firmware audition, this type of vulnerability recurs and threatens users’ privacy and data security.
Security researcher Elliot Williams posted on Hackaday that most GSM-to-IP devices made by DBLTek have a remotely accessible hardcoded credential which leads to a shell with root privileges.
The finding was reported to the manufacturer, who didn’t really fix the underlying vulnerability.
Instead, they implemented a workaround: they added an extra challenge-response process, whose algorithm can be obtained by reverse-engineering.
Trustwave’s blog post summarizes the entire chain of events.
A tool exploiting this vulnerability is also available on Github.
On Shodan, a search engine for Internet-connected devices, I was able to find exposed DBLTek GoIP devices both with and without the extra “challenge”.
Randomly tested devices showed that they were updated to the newer firmware with a challenge-response.
Figure
Shodan search for vulnerable DBLTek devices
A compromised GoIP device might cause security risks to VoIP software which is usually on a LAN, resulting in unauthorized inbound/outbound calls, access to voicemail boxes, SIP trunks, and lateral movement.
Since it may also work in router mode (which works like a home router), a compromised device can also lead to risks for computers behind it.
Trend Micro recommends against connecting IoT and VoIP gateway products directly to the Internet, as this leaves these devices without the benefit of the protection provided by a router.
Based on the incidents we saw in 2016, I recommend that organizations enter 2017 with caution.
From the growth of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks to cybercriminals using more effective ways to exploit Internet of Things (IoT) devices, these security issues should serve as a reminder for businesses and individuals to be more vigilant.
Looking ahead, one of the most pressing matters that a lot of organizations need to pay attention to is the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The new set of rules is designed to harmonize data protection across all EU member states and bring in a number of key components that will directly impact businesses—including businesses outside Europe.
Much has been said about the GDPR, but what is the most realistic data protection design for organizations?
This should be the one of the questions you need to ask yourself as a business.
My answer to that would be only collect what you need to collect.
How much personal information do you really need to collect?
For example, a customer’s birthday might not be pertinent to your business—so you must get rid of it.
If you have an existing collection of data that is not required to do business, then you need to redesign the database and drop these unnecessary fields.
During the transition period until the GDPR takes effect in May 2018, organizations have to prepare to be compliant.
Here are some of the common compliance issues your company could face:
Fines – the GDPR maintains that non-compliance or violations could cost companies up to 4% of global annual turnover, or €20 million, in administrative fines
Data Breach Notification – the new regulation will require companies to notify the data protection supervisory authority of data breaches within 72 hours
Right to erasure – to emphasize my earlier statement, only collect what you need to collect.
This means companies have to delete personal data and any related links if they no longer find it accurate or relevant to the business
Right to information and transparency – customers should have the right to opt out and have a very clear understanding of how you store their personal data and what you do with it.
In Trend Micro’s 2017 Security Predictions, we said that the GDPR is expected to raise administrative costs, but the extent will really depend on what the companies are doing at the moment.
Most European companies are already bound by local regulations within the countries, so adapting to the GDPR should not be so difficult because some of them already have even stricter rules.
However, in other countries, especially where businesses store customer data for marketing purposes, they will need to do a complete redesign of their database to comply with the GDPR.
Companies should factor in the fines for non-compliance.
In TalkTalk’s case, where it was hit with a record £400,000 fine for not having proper website security, that fine could possibly amount to millions if the GDPR was already in effect.
So companies should be taking their data protection practices more seriously, especially with the impending regulation.
Companies in Europe are worried about the implementation costs, while companies in the US believe that they will pay fines because they cannot comply.
I predict that in 2018, companies who do not comply will not only suffer fines but managers could risk going to jail as well in case of intentional violations with the purpose of enrichment or impairment —which could lead to serious implications on your business’s reputation.
Consequently, I expect small law firms to make money by finding customers who can testify against non-compliant businesses and sue them.
Is there enough time to prepare until May 2018?
It should be because companies already know that it is coming, as GDPR was adopted in April 2016.
Since it has been under discussion in the European Parliament for five years, organizations must already be aware and act on their compliance strategies as early as now.
While the GDPR could be burdensome for many companies, it’s not all doom and gloom.
It will still ultimately teach companies to apply better security practices on data handling, which will increase customer trust and enhance technological neutrality.
Know where your data is stored – The GDPR dictates that “personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.”
Make sure that you don’t store more information than you need for that purpose.
Use well-established security controls – reassess security policies and invest in a provider that can offer encryption of data in the cloud, network security, advanced anti-malware, IDS/IPS virtual patching and data loss prevention.
Designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if you are an enterprise – in line with the GDPR requirements, you might have to seek legal advice to determine if your company should designate a DPO or not.
If you are an enterprise and not an SMB, you are more likely to need one.
A DPO would help the IT department and the board improve data protection processes and security, and will be tasked to monitor compliance with the data protection provisions.
From the looks of it, many companies both in and outside Europe will have a tough time adhering to these new regulations.
Updated on January 25, 2017, 06:20 AM (UTC-7):
We updated the appropriate cost of fines and timeline.
Based on an INTERPOL survey featured in a joint Trend Micro-INTERPOL research paper, West African cybercriminals stole an average of US$2.7 million from businesses and an average of US$422,000 from individuals from 2013 to 2015.
Scams or various types of fraud, whether simple (like 419 or Nigerian prince scams) or complex (like business email compromise [BEC] scams), run rampant in the West African threat landscape.
In fact, most of the online scams we see now may have to do with the increase in the region’s cybercriminal activity volume.
While conducting research on cybercrime in West Africa, we stumbled upon a scamming operation dubbed “Z*N.” In it, the cybercriminal uses keyloggers to gather the email credentials of employees in order to hijack ongoing financial transactions.
As such, hijacked funds ended up in accounts that the cybercriminal control.
The cybercriminal mistakenly installed the keylogger onto his own computer.
This “slip” allowed us to access his logs and find details about him (personal data) and his operation.
It also gave us an insight into what goes on in a typical scamming operation:
Steps in a typical scamming operation
West African cybercriminals can be classified into two major types—Yahoo! boys and next-level cybercriminals.
They are around 20−29 years old and have basic technical know-how and so run simpler scams (advance-fee, stranded-traveler, and romance scams).
They communicate with fellow cybercriminals through social media and typically follow a ringleader or mastermind.
Next-level cybercriminals, meanwhile, run more complex scams akin to “long cons” (tax and BEC scams).
They are more tech-savvy and frequent underground forums to obtain tools like malware.
The volume of cybercriminal activities in West Africa has been increasing.
And the region’s cybercriminals are evolving—going for more complex than simpler scams to gain more profit.
Are we bound to see a West African underground market emerge soon?
Although 30% of all the cybercrime reported to law enforcement agencies in West Africa lead to arrests, roadblocks like obtaining information from overseas and finding cybercriminals’ actual physical locations still exist.
This is especially true for money mules (in next-level cybercriminals’ networks) who reside abroad.
Typically, money mules are fellow West Africans who have bank accounts in the countries their affiliates wish to steal money from.
Only a few money mules get arrested though.
This could be due to the fact that mules reside outside West Africa and so are no longer part of the region’s police jurisdiction.
West African law enforcement agencies thus focus more on arresting IT  technicians (who take care of an operation’s infrastructure) and fraud operators (who actually engage in social engineering activities), especially since they reside within the region.
Trend Micro will continue collaborating with agencies like INTERPOL to thwart cybercrime.

The Android security bulletin for March, published last March 6, contains 15 vulnerabilities that we discovered and privately disclosed to Google.
Like some of our previous discoveries, many of these new vulnerabilities concern Mediaserver, which is the component responsible for scanning and indexing all available media files in the Android operating system.
Google encourages owners of Android-based devices to avoid any potential issues by accepting their over-the-air (OTA) update which address these vulnerabilities.
However, it should also be noted that Google can only directly update devices that are using native Android operating systems.
As such, users who are unable to directly receive these updates may need to confirm with their service providers or device manufacturers to see if an update is available.
Vulnerability details
Of the 15 vulnerabilities, eight were rated Critical: An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities can use specially crafted files – specifically H.264 and H.265 videos- to cause memory corruption during file processing.
In addition, these new vulnerabilities can potentially allow attackers to run remote code executions via Mediaserver processes.
However, unlike the earlier vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-3823 and CVE-2015-3824 which were caused primarily by bad media format parsing, the newest batch is caused by issues surrounding the media decoder codec.
In addition to these, we also discovered additional vulnerabilities which were rated by Google as High severity.
These particularly vulnerabilities involve a denial of service attack, in which the perpetrator can use crafted media files to trigger an indefinite Mediaserver loop.
This causes the target device to become extremely sluggish and can even cause random reboots.
While the denial of service itself is easy to trigger, Android has enhanced the security features of Mediaserver making it more difficult to compromise the device itself.
We also reported a third Mediaserver vulnerability, which was rated by Google as of Moderate severity.
CVE-2017-0495 is an information disclosure vulnerability which fetches data from the Mediaserver memory.
The main purpose of this vulnerability is to get other vulnerabilities, particularly remote code executions, working.
A Moderate priority information disclosure vulnerability dealing with AOSP Messaging and Android Messages rounds up our reported discoveries for March.
Cybercriminals exploiting CVE-2017-0494 can use specially crafted GIF files to gain access to potentially sensitive data in the Messaging app beyond their normal permission levels.
Many of these vulnerabilities require a specially crafted file before they can be exploited, thus users should be aware of the websites they visit – particularly online streaming video sites that can trigger these exploits.
In addition, these vulnerabilities can be nipped in the bud by regularly applying the latest patches from Google.
End users can protect their mobile devices by downloading Trend Micro Mobile Security (TMMS), which can detect threats that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities.

How is it possible for users to lose hundreds of dollars in anomalous online bank transfers when all of their gadgets have security software installed?
Last year, user Y, who is based in Brazil, lost R$600 (US$191.02, as of January 30, 2017) as a side effect of information theft.
Upon discovering this, Y immediately called an IT technician to find the root cause.
The technician originally chalked up the incident to Y accessing a fake website.
But since no malware was found in the devices connected to the network, he then reviewed the home router settings.
What he found was interesting:  even though the home router did not expose any remote management interface to the internet, the DNS settings were still modified.
As a solution, the IT technician reset and reconfigured the home router to stop cybercriminals from making further bank transfers.
In another case, user X noticed R$3,000 (US$955.11, as of January 30, 2017) was deducted from her account last January 2016.
Her home router was also infected with a malicious DNS-changing malware.
But instead of bank websites, cybercriminals redirected her to spoofed pages of third-party sites used by banks, such as Google Adsense™ and JQuery.
For one, security flaws exist in the operating system, firmware, and web applications of routers.
Attackers can simply use these vulnerabilities as entry points to further compromise the home network.
In fact, there are a few tools and websites that  cybercriminals use to find vulnerable routers and obtain exploits for their attacks.
Below is an example of such website:
A trading website that displays a list of home router exploits (Click to enlarge)
Predefined credentials in routers make it easy for web-based scripts  to bypass device authentication mechanisms and allow cybercriminals to perform  brute-force attacks.
Web-based scripts are an effective tactic to infiltrate routers.
Another security gap are remote administration features in router firmware that cybercriminals can abuse to function as “built-in backdoors.”
This could lead to a plethora of problems: remote code execution,  modified router settings to redirect to phishing or malicious pages,  and man-in-the-middle attacks, among others.
Vendors should make it a point to find and remove these backdoors in their products before attackers do.
Are home routers safe?
It’s easy to overlook router security in a home setting since most home router attacks are isolated cases or have very minimal effect on a user’s bandwidth.
Unless a user experiences attacks like the ones mentioned above, router security is the least of a user’s concerns.
This can be a problematic mindset moving forward.
What home users need to understand is that home routers serve as a gateway in and out of their home.
All the information coming from the internet will have to pass through it.
Routers are their private property, and any form of compromise is like a form of trespassing.
Some router threats that take advantage of its communications with connected devices can even make home users unwitting accomplices to cybercriminal activities.
Case in point, the Mirai botnet took advantage of unsecure IoT devices for different attacks last year.
When the source code was leaked in a hacking forum, we saw new Mirai strains in the wild.
Affected entities like small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) may have to deal with business disruption, damaged reputation, or even productivity and profit loss.
Figure 2.
Mirai uses a predefined list of default credentials to infect devices.
Knowing this, it is essential for home users to change router passwords.
This measure can provide an additional layer of security.
As we mentioned in our 2017 Security Predictions, the likelihood of Mirai-like threats used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks may increase this year, so it’s necessary to take precautions.
Apart from botnet clients, other threats like rootkits that specifically infect Linux can also be dangerous to routers.
Voice over IP (VoIP) fraud, which taps the telephony service in routers, could amount to additional charges in a user’s phone or internet bills.
How can home users protect their routers?
The first step in protecting home routers is choosing reliable ones.
Some routers, like that of ASUS, are now bundled with security features.
Trend Micro recently partnered with the brand to address home network security risks.
ASUS routers come with features like deep packet inspection and web threat protection that filter threats before they reach users’ devices.
Aside from selecting a secure router, users should also change the default router password to thwart brute-force attacks.
Regular checking of DNS settings can also aid users and SMBs to spot anything suspicious in their network.
If a user’s router has a firewall, they should enable it as another form of protection against threats.
To better understand router threats and to learn how to secure your home network, read our research paper, Securing Your Home Routers: Understanding Attacks and Defense Strategies.
In 2016, 91 percent of the U.S. population had health insurance coverage which means at a given time, any person will be effected in the event of a healthcare data breach.
How it affects individuals may differ case by case perspective, but its impact to affected people and healthcare institutions are far from mild.
In our latest research paper titled Cybercrime and Other Threats Faced by Healthcare Industry, we look at the other side of a healthcare data breach and trace back what happens to electronic health records (EHR) after they are stolen.
The multiple uses of Electronic Health Records on the Deep Web
An EHR is a data set that contains personally identifiable information (PII), financial information such as insurance data, payment transactions, as well as personal health related information such as medical prescriptions, history records, appointment schedules, and other medical related information used by physicians.
Each of those data sets are items that have value to cybercriminals.
Financial information and PII are the data that are usually lost in data breaches and sold in underground markets.
However, what about health related information?
Are cybercriminals interested in physician’s appointments or medication taken by the victim?
Monetizing raw data such as PII is nothing new in the Underground.
What makes EHR in the Underground so different is that some of the data can be used to create a whole new list of offerings.
These wares include fraudulent documents like tax returns or fake IDs, fake driver’s licenses or birth certificates, but also stolen prescriptions with which the buyer can buy drugs.
This gives them access to controlled substances such as Ambien, a popular sleep disorder medication known to be abused by many users.
Figure 2.
Cyberattacks against hospitals, healthcare providers and doctors cost the U.S. healthcare industry more than estimated $6 billion a year with an average data breach costing a hospital around $2.1 million.
As for the victims, 65 percent of medical identity fraud victims end up paying an average of $13,500 on legal fees and creditor service fees when trying to resolve the issue.
Compared to other breaches, victims that lost their healthcare data experience more difficulties dealing with the breach.
Unlike credit card breaches, medical identify theft can take more than three months before it is reported.
Victims might not even know they were affected since credit bureaus wait 180 days after a service to charge one’s line of credit.
This can effectively ruin personal credit scores.
To make matters worse, EHR contains data that does not expire like date of birth, social security numbers, and so on.
This means that cybercriminals can reuse the victim’s information over and over.
After EHR in the underground is sold, victims have no way of knowing whether their records have been tampered with or modified by someone who could have bought and then used their stolen profile.
The actual impact on manipulated documents and fraudulent use are still unclear.

A worm was found in the safe garden of Apple.
About 40 iOS apps are now being cleaned out of the App Store because they turned out to be infected with malicious code, which had been designed to build a botnet out of Apple devices.
XcodeGhost malware for iOS detected
The malware XcodeGhost affected dozens of apps, including: WeChat app (600+ million users), NetEase’s music downloading app, business card scanner CamCard, and Didi Kuaidi’s Uber-like car hailing app.
To make matters worse, the Chinese versions of Angry Birds 2 was infected – is nothing sacred anymore?
Apple spends a lot of time and effort to monitor each and every app in the Apple Store.
These efforts set App Store apart from Google Play and third-party stores, which were literally stalked by malicious software (at least until Google launched it’s own malware scanning system in 2014).
Against this background, September 2015 seems to be especially unsuccessful for Apple as experts found malware that targeted jailbroken devices and everybody spoke about the “biggest theft ever involving Apple accounts,” and now Palo Alto Networks company has found compromised software on the App Store.

XcodeGhost #iOS Malware Contained: https://kas.pr/Cy1Z  via @threatpost #apple
Xcode is a free suite of tools used by software developers to create apps for iOS and Apple Store.
XcodeGhost is malicious software, designed to affect the Xcode and thereby compromise apps, created with infected tools.
Allegedly 40 or even more apps on #AppStore are infected #Apple #malware
Apple’s official Xcode was not compromised, the problem is with the unofficial version of the tool uploaded to the cloud storage service of Baidu (Think China’s Google).
It’s a common practice in China to download necessary tools from third sites, and this time it turned out to be very bad habit.
There is a reason why Chinese developers choose unofficial and insecure sites instead of safe official resources.
Internet in the country is rather slow; moreover, Chinese government limits access to foreign servers to three gateways.
As installation package of Xcode tools size is about 3.59 GB, downloading it from Apple’s servers could take a decent amount of time.

Apple's iOS App Store suffers first major attack
Apple Inc APPL.O said on Sunday it is cleaning up its iOS App Store to remove malicious iPhone and iPad programs identified in the first large-scale attack on the popular mobile software outlet.
So what actor behind the XcodeGhost needed to do was to infect an unofficial pack of tools with a smart and imperceptible malware and let legitimate developers do the job for them.
Researchers at Palo Alto Networks determined that malicious Xcode package had been available for six months and had been downloaded and used to build numerous new and updated iOS apps.
Then they were naturally pushed into the App Store and somehow bypassed Apple’s anti-malware scanning system.

Cancun, Mexico — Researchers from Kaspersky Lab have uncovered the first ever Arabic language advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
Dubbed Desert Falcons, the group of thirty or so attackers — some of whom are known by name — operates out of Palestine, Egypt and Turkey and is said to have developed and deployed their wares exclusively in the Middle East.
It is impossible to determine whether Desert Falcons is state sponsored.
Their arsenal consists of homemade malware tools, social engineering and other techniques designed to execute and conceal campaigns on traditional and mobile operating systems.
Particularly, Desert Falcons’ malware is intended to steal sensitive information from its victims, which is then used to fuel further operations and even for extortion attempts against impacted targets.

The victims, according to Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, are targeted for secrets in their possession or intelligence information relating to their positions in governments or important organizations.
“More than 1 million files were stolen from victims,” the anti-malware company said.
“Stolen files include diplomatic communications from embassies, military plans and documents, financial documents, VIP and Media contact lists and files.”
Desert #FalconsAPT revealed by @Kaspersky Lab at #TheSAS2015 is the first exclusively middle eastern #APT:
The victims include military and government organizations, employees responsible for health organizations and combating money laundering, economic and financial institutions, leading media entities, research and educational institutions, energy and utilities providers, activists and political leaders, physical security companies, and other targets that have access to important geopolitical information.
Tools used in the Desert Falcons attack include backdoors into traditional computers through which the attackers install malware capable of logging keystrokes, taking screenshots and even remotely recording audio.
There is also a mobile component for Android with the capacity to spy in SMS text and call logs.
Interestingly, researchers presenting on Desert Falcons at Kaspersky Lab’s Security Analyst Summit said these are among the first to use Facebook chats in targeted attacks, connecting with targets via common Facebook pages until gaining their trust and sending them Trojan files via a chat hidden as a photo.
The group began building its tools as early as 2011 and achieved its first infections in 2013, but it wasn’t until the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015 that Desert Falcons’ activity really began to spike.
It seems that the group is more active now than it has been at any point in the past.
Kaspersky Lab says its products detect and block all variants of the malware used in this campaign.

Yesterday researchers said they discovered and disclosed to Apple, the vulnerability exploited by the WireLurker malware, which targeted iOS mobile devices via infections through USB connections to Mac OS X and Windows machines.
Masque-Attack-all-new-iOS-vulnerability_fb
The vulnerability is called “Masque” and it affects iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 8.1.1 beta.
Perhaps most interestingly, while initial reports suggested that the malware could only infect iOS user-devices via USB connection, researchers from FireEye yesterday said that the Masque bug is also exploitable by SMS text messages and email.
However, in order to infect via SMS or email, the attacker would have to compel a victim to follow a link leading to the malicious apps.
Researchers disclose a powerful #iOS vulnerability responsible for the #WireLurker #Apple #malware
Technically, Masque gives attackers the ability to replace legitimate iOS apps with malicious ones without notification.
In part, the flaw relates to an iOS enterprise provisioning failure to double check the identity of a given app against its digital certificate when the developer does not upload the application to the App Store.
So in this case, iOS did not flag WireLurker’s certificates, which were legitimately signed – albeit using a different certificate – because the malware merely uploaded the application directly to the user’s phone from the infected desktop or laptop.
This is why, unlike earlier iOS malware, WireLurker had the capacity to infect non-jailbroken devices.

FireEye says that WireLurker is the only in the wild attack targeting the Masque vulnerability, but that it also appears to have been circulated among criminals.
The Masque bug remains unpatched.
To Apple’s credit, they moved fast to invalidate the certificates used by the malicious malware.
The need for anti-malware protection on Mac OS X devices cannot be overstated.
Shortly after the security firm Palo Alto Networks published their WireLurker findings last week, the group responsible for the malware shut their operation down.
However, when it was still up and running, it aimed to infect Windows and Mac machines, where it would lie dormant until the infected user attached an iPhone or iPod to his or her personal computer.
When and if that occurred, the malware then searched the connected iOS device for the presence of a few popular applications.
If present, WireLurker uninstalled those apps and replaced them with fake, trojanized replicas.
It is not clear what data the malware ultimately sought.

The only users that would have been impacted by WireLurker were users who had downloaded applications from a third-party application marketplace in China called Maiyadi.
Palo Alto researchers said, 467 infected OS X apps have been found on Maiyadi and those apps have been downloaded more than 350,000 times as of Oct. 16, by more than 100,000 users.
“The need for anti-malware protection on Mac OS X devices cannot be overstated,” explained Kaspersky’s global research and analysis team in a Securelist report.
“It’s not only that your Mac OS X machine can get infected, but WireLurker showed us how the infection can move from your Mac to your iPhone.
The good news is: there are plenty of options to chose from out there, including our own Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac.”

Many people still think that malware is a software that completely disrupts the normal functioning of PCs.
If your computer is working well, it means it’s not infected, right?
The main goal of cybercriminals is not to make a cyber-disaster just for kicks, but to earn money.
In many cases this goal dictates the complete opposite behavior of malware: the best one is the least visible to users.
Is your PC a part of Simda botnet?
For instance, such ‘stealth’ behavior is often typical for botnets.
Owners of these computers don’t have any idea that they are infected.
All they can see is that their PC works a bit slower, which is not unusual for PCs in general.
Botnets are designed to gather personal data including passwords, social security numbers, credit card details, addresses and telephone numbers.
This data may be used in crimes including identity theft, various types of fraud, spamming, and other malware distribution.

Kaspersky along with Intel and ShadowServer help to bring down the Beebone botnet - http://ow.ly/Lo9yq
6:25 AM - 10 Apr 2015
It always takes a lot of effort by many cooperating parties to shut down a large botnet.
A recent example is the Simda botnet, which is believed to have infected more than 770,000 computers in more than 190 countries.
Distribution of victims of Simda botnet by country
Simda is a ‘vending botnet’ used to distribute illicit software and different types of malware, including those capable of stealing financial credentials.
Creators of the specific malicious programs were simply paying the Simda owners a fee per each install.
In other words, this botnet was a kind of huge trade chain for malware ‘manufacturers’.
The botnet was active for years.
To make the malware more effective, Simda owners were working hard on new versions, generating and distributing them as frequently as every few hours.
At the moment, Kaspersky Lab’s virus collection contains more than 260,000 executable files belonging to different versions of the Simda malware.
Is your PC a part of the huge #Simda #botnet?
A simultaneous take-down of 14 command and control servers of the Simda botnet located in the Netherlands, US, Luxembourg, Russia and Poland was carried out on Thursday, April 9th.
The list of organization involved in this shut down operation perfectly illustrates its complexity.
INTERPOL, Microsoft, Kaspersky Lab, Trend Micro, Cyber Defense Institute, FBI, Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), Police Grand-Ducale Section Nouvelles Technologies in Luxembourg, and Russian Ministry of the Interior’s Department ‘K’ were working together to counteract the cybercriminals.

“Botnets are geographically distributed networks and it is usually a challenging task to take down such a thing.
That’s why the collaborative effort of both private and public sectors is crucial here – every party makes its own important contribution to the joint project,” said Vitaly Kamluk, Principal Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab, and currently working closely with INTERPOL.
“In this case, Kaspersky Lab’s role was to provide technical analysis of the bot, collect botnet telemetry from the Kaspersky Security Network and advise on takedown strategies.”
As the investigation is still ongoing, it is too early to tell who is behind the Simda botnet.
What is important for users is that as a result of the disruption operation, command and control servers used by criminals to communicate with infected machines have been shut down.
Although the Simda botnet operation is suspended, people whose PCs were infected should get rid of this malware as soon as possible.
Using information retreived from the Simda botnet’s command and control servers, Kaspersky Lab has created a special page where you can check, if your computer’s IP address is in the list of infected ones.

The Chinese-language Naikon advanced persistent threat group is targeting military, government and civil organizations located in and around the South China Sea, which is an increasingly contentious hot-bed of territorial disputes between various Southeast Asian nations.
Naikon is also known as APT-30.
Its targets, according to a new report from Kaspersky Lab’s global research and analysis team, are said to include the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, and Nepal.
Naikon APT expansion map
Like many APT campaigns, Naikon infects its victims with spear-phishing emails in which malicious executables masquerade as seemingly relevant document attachments.
When a victim opens one of these malicious attachments, a decoy document appears as an executable file and quietly exploits an old Microsoft Office vulnerability, installing malware on the victim’s machine.
For five years, the APT group has employed cultural liasons for each of its target countries.
In this way, Naikon is able to exploit cultural tendencies, such as the reliance on personal email addresses to conduct business.
Attackers exploited this reality by creating email addresses that appeared similar to those in actual use, which the attackers were able to leverage to send more effective phishing messages.

The group has also installed portions of its command and control infrastructure in the target countries in order to provide daily support for real-time connections and data theft.
They also have the capacity to intercept traffic across entire victim networks and issue some 48 distinct and remote commands, including taking a complete inventory of system files, downloading and uploading data, installing add-on modules, or working with the command line or prompt.
Taken together, these 48 commands allow the threat group to take complete control over any Naikon-infected machine.
Naikon’s ultimate goal is to gather geopolitical information.
The criminals behind the Naikon attacks managed to devise a very flexible infrastructure that can be set up in any target country
“The criminals behind the Naikon attacks managed to devise a very flexible infrastructure that can be set up in any target country, with information tunneling from victim systems to the command center,” explained Kaspersky Lab principle security researcher, Kurt Baumgartner.
“If the attackers then decide to hunt down another target in another country, they could simply set up a new connection.
Having dedicated operators focused on their own particular set of targets also makes things easy for the Naikon espionage group.”
In one country that Kaspersky Lab declined to name, the Naikon hackers managed to compromise Office of the President, Military Forces, Office of the Cabinet Secretary, National Security Council, Office of the Solicitor General, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency, Civil Aviation Authority, Department of Justice, Federal Police and Executive/Presidential Administration and Management Staff.
The #Naikon #APT is designed to steal geopolitical information from nation’s located around the South China Sea
Kaspersky Lab experts recommend that users never open attachments from people they don’t know, use an advanced anti-malware solution, and keep operating systems patched and up-to-date.
APT Asia geopolitics malware spear phishing threats
What is really worth mentioning is that this attack’s initial penetration method is based entirely on social engineering techniques.
And, unfortunately, it is quite a successful approach for many targeted attacks.
The attackers are offering an extremely funny video about office-working apes as bait.
The archive, including an executable video, is delivered via spear-phishing emails containing an attachment or a link to a website, sometimes a legitimate and even highly-rated site that has already been compromised.
How to mitigate CozyDuke / Office Monkey threat
While the video plays, the attack’s dropper is silently installed into the system, ready to receive commands and second stage malware components from the Command & Control servers.
The cybercriminals were not mistaken in thinking that many recipients would launch the video.
Not only have they launched it; they’ve shared it with office colleagues, thus actively assisting in the malware distribution process.
Given the high profile of the targets, the amount of sensitive information potentially stolen could be plentiful.
So the question is: how do you mitigate such a horrific threat, when even your own trusted employees are working against your carefully built security?
For sure, you shouldn’t underestimate the power of social engineering: how many loyal employees would, for example, resist opening a link in a (carefully forged) letter from their boss?
How to mitigate an Office Monkey threat
Actually, several very basic security precautions or Mitigation Strategies can work effectively against even the most sophisticated and thoroughly planned APTs.
For example, a simple curbing of administrative rights plus the timely patching of vulnerabilities and restricting the number of permitted apps can mitigate up to 85% of targeted attack-connected incidents.
Kaspersky lab’s Application Control with Dynamic Whitelisting would be a valuable asset here.
The Monkey video — as well as the other malware components of CozyDuke — would simply not be able to launch without being previously approved by a system administrator.

Some administrative staff may have a limited range of duties and responsibilities, while dealing on a day-to-day basis with highly sensitive correspondence.
Such a working scenario may be best addressed through adopting a Default Deny Applications Control mode, strictly limiting allowed executables to those system components and programs absolutely necessary to the individual’s work activities.
Other useful strategies, especially appropriate to government agencies or other highly regulated enterprises, may include:
Using Web Control technology to restrict access only to permitted web resources, limited to those that are work-related — or at least only to certain site categories.
Applying e-mail content filtering, as offered by Kaspersky Security for Exchange / Linux Mail, to rule out suspicious emails and attachments (such as archives), perhaps depending on the recipient’s role and seniority.
Using Device Control technology to avoid unsolicited transfers of information through the security perimeter to and from the outside world — or even within the perimeter.
As well as helping prevent the spread of malware, this approach can offer protection against some forms of intentional data theft.
Conducting specialized security training for employees, such as that offered by Kaspersky Lab as part of the Security Intelligence Services.
This will drive increased awareness and understanding of the dangers they face, even while they sit in their well-guarded offices.
It also educates them on how to avoid many seemingly innocent, yet unsafe practices that could cost their business a fortune — or even constitute a threat to their country’s security.

Take TeslaCrypt, for example.
It is a relatively new family of ransomware; its samples were first detected in February 2015.
The notable feature of the early TeslaCrypt versions was that malware was targeting not only usual sets of files, including documents, pictures and videos, but games-related file types as well.
By that time, it was a rather weak malware due to a couple of its technical flaws.
TeslaCrypt 2.0 ransomware
Despite the fact malware creators scared their victims with the frightful RSA-2048 algorithm, in reality the encryption was not that strong.
Moreover, during the encryption process the malware stored encryption keys in a file on the victim’s computer hard drive, making it possible to save the key by interrupting the encryptor’s operation, or to extract the key before the respective area of the disk was overwritten.
In the latest TeslaCrypt 2.0 version, which was recently discovered by Kaspersky Lab researchers, malware creators have implemented some new features preventing decryption of stolen files and discovery of malware’s command&control servers.

The best line of #defense against any #ransomware is to have backed up your machines yesterday.

A new variant of the Onion ransomware has emerged, though you might see it referred to as CTB-Locker or Citroni.Whatever you decide to call it, CTB-Locker is a Cryptolocker-like piece of malware t
First, they’ve adopted the sophisticated elliptic curve encryption algorithm from creators of the famous and very troublesome CTB-Locker ransomware.
Secondly, they’ve changed the method of key storaging: now they are using the system registry instead of a file on disk.
Thirdly, TeslaCrypt creators have stolen the web page which victims see after their files have been encrypted from another ransomware family, CryptoWall.
Of course, all payment credentials are changed, but the rest of the text, which is very effective from a ‘selling’ point of view, is fully copied.
By the way, the ransom is rather large: about $500 at the current bitcoin exchange rate.
TeslaCrypt ransomware page
Malware from the TeslaCrypt family is known to be distributed using exploit kits such as Angler, Sweet Orange, and Nuclear.
This method of distributing malware works as follows: When a victim visits an infected website, an exploit’s malicious code uses vulnerabilities in the browser (usually in plugins) to install target malware in the system.
#TeslaCrypt 2.0 #ransomware: stronger and more complicated
Kaspersky Lab products detect malware from the TeslaCrypt family, including the latest version discussed above, as Trojan-Ransom.
Win32.Bitman.
So, our users are not in danger.
TeslaCrypt geography
Our recommendations on counteracting this and other families of ransomware include the following:
Create backup copies of all your important files on a regular basis.
Copies should be kept on media that are physically disconnected immediately after the backup copying is completed.
The last part is important, because the TeslaCrypt and other types of malware encrypt connected drives and network folders as well as the local hard drive.
It is crucially important to update your software in a timely fashion, especially the web browser and its plugins.
In case a malicious program lands on your system, it will be best addressed by the latest version of a security software with updated databases and activated security modules.

The up-to-date Windows 8.1 comes with a built-in firewall and a type of anti-virus protection delivered via Defender.
Browser developers continue to think about security as well: for example, Chrome tries to detect suspicious sites and warn you before opening them, and it’s sandboxing system is supposed to prevent malware from going out from one tab and infecting all the others.
The continual evolution of mobile malware
Of course, these levels of protection aren’t perfect and in many cases they frequently fail.
That’s why people install complex security solutions and let those solutions protect them.
The problem is that smartphones and tablets do not look like PCs — and maybe that’s why only a few treat their security seriously.
Actually, your smartphone is a computer – a rather powerful one for that matter.
It is connected to your financial accounts and in addition it’s almost certainly poorly protected.

Fake mobile banks steal money
In 2015 we detected 7,030 new mobile banking Trojans.
This kind of malware is getting quite smart and learning new hurtful tricks.
For example, certain Trojans are capable of overlaying the on-screen display of a legitimate banking app with a fake copy, created for phishing purposes.
The victim sees a familiar interface, enters the credit card data and stays with card balance reset to 0.
OpFake is one of the most notable examples of such programs as it can imitate the interface of more than 100 legitimate banking and financial apps.
The Acecard family is also quite qualified: it can spoof at least 30 banking apps as well as overlay any app following the C&C server commands.

Sometimes Trojans come together with official apps from your bank.
For example, the SmsThief malware, detected in Q2 2015, was embedded in a legitimate banking app.
This was done without affecting its operation, making this malware more difficult to detect.
As it’s clear from its name, this Trojan steals victim’s’ messages and sends them to the attackers together with other information like the device model and some personal data.
Another approach utilized by criminals is to target a broader circle of apps, not just the Internet banking applications.
For example, FakeInst Trojan displays a message, presumably from Google, demanding that the user opens Google Wallet and goes through an ‘identification’ procedure, which involves entering credit card details.
The reasons can be quite different including even the need to combat cybercrime.
This window cannot be removed until the victim enters the credit card details and… you know what comes next.
The amount of Trojan-Ransom families doubled in 2015 compared to the previous year, while the number of detected modifications increased 3.5 times.
Moreover, in 2015 the amount of victims increased fivefold.
It looks like those cybercriminals who were already creating Ransomware continued to do so, and their profit lures new players to the market.

When one of these Trojans blocks a device, the user is often accused of committing some alleged misdemeanor, like failing to protect their devices.
They also have to pay to unblock their gadget – the ransom ranging from $12 to $100.
In such a way your child photos or sweetheart’s selfies can cost you a dinner or a fashion item, and bring millions to criminals, who gather money from hundreds and thousands of victims.
Mobile ransomware is likely to continue evolving in 2016.
The popularity of these programs among attackers is growing and this leads to future expansion.
This type of malware remains a serious threat, though its share in the overall flow of mobile threats is gradually declining.
In case you don’t know, these programs send paid text messages from an infected device or subscribe the victims to paid services.
Of course, the users stay unaware of what is going on and why the money is written off their accounts.

Security experts often mention exploits as one of the most serious problems with data and systems safety; although it’s not always clear what the difference is between exploits and the malware in general.
Exploits are a subset of malware.
These malicious programs contain data or executable code, which is able to take advantage of one or more vulnerabilities in the software running on a local or remote computer.
Put Simply: You have a browser and there is a vulnerability in it that allow “an arbitrary code” to run (i.e. install and launch some malicious program) on your system without your knowledge.
Most often the first step for the attackers is allowing privilege escalation, so they can do anything within the attacked system.

Browsers, along with Flash, Java, and Microsoft Office, are among the most targeted software categories.
Being ubiquitous, they are actively explored by security experts and hackers alike, and developers regularly have to release patches to fix vulnerabilities.
It’s best if these patches are applied at once, but unfortunately that is not always the case.
For instance, you should close all browser tabs or documents to perform an update.
Another problem is exploits for the yet unknown vulnerabilities, discovered and abused by blackhats: so-called zero-days or 0days.
It may take a while before the vendors know they have a problem and work it over.
Infection routes
Cybercriminals often prefer exploits over other infection methods like social engineering – which can be hit or miss – the use of vulnerabilities continues to produce the desired results.
First, by visiting a site that contains malicious exploit code.
Second, by opening a seemingly legitimate file with hidden malicious code.
As one may easily guess, it’s most likely spam or a phishing email that will bring the exploit in.

Why #phishing works and how to avoid it - https://kas.pr/m4Mk  #security #cybercrime
11:05 PM - 1 Oct 2014
Phishing attacks are by far the most popular form of cybercrime in the 21st century.
The media regularly reports lists of organizations whose customers fell victim to phishing attacks.
As noted in Securelist, exploits are designed to strike specific versions of software that contain vulnerabilities.
If the user has that version of the software to open the malicious object, or if a website is using that software to operate, the exploit is triggered.
Once it gains access through the vulnerability, the exploit then loads additional malware from the criminals’ server which performs malicious activity such as stealing personal data, using the computer as part of a botnet to distribute spam or carry out DDoS attacks, or whatever the culprits behind it intend to do.
Exploits pose a threat even for the aware and diligent users who keep their software updated.
The reason is a time gap between the discovery of vulnerability and a release of the patch to fix it.
During that time, exploits are able to function freely and threaten the security of nearly all Internet users – unless there are automatic tools to prevent exploit attacks installed.
And don’t forget about above mentioned ‘open tabs syndrome’: there’s a price to be paid for update, and not every user is ready to pay it right away when a patch is available.
Exploits are often packed together so that an attacked system is checked against a wide range of vulnerabilities; once one or more are detected, the appropriate exploits enter.
Exploit kits also widely use code obfuscation to avoid detection and encrypt URL paths to prevent researchers from unrooting them.
Angler – one of the most sophisticated kits on the underground market.
This one changed the game after it had begun detecting antivirus and virtual machines (often used by security researchers as honeypots), and deploying encrypted dropper files.
It is one of the fastest kits to incorporate newly released zero-days and its malware runs from memory, without having to write to the hard drives of its victims.
Technical description of the pack is available here.

Blackhole, unlike most of the others kits, has a dedicated entry in Wikipedia, although after Paunch’s arrest the kit itself has almost died out.
Conclusion
Exploits are not always detectable by security software.
To successfully detect exploit the security software should employ behavior analysis – it’s the only good way to beat exploits.
Malware programs may be plentiful and varied, but most of them have similar behavioral patterns.
Kaspersky Internet Security, as well as other Kaspersky Lab’s flagship products employ a technology which is called Automatic Exploit Prevention and uses the information about the most typical behavior of the known exploits.
The characteristic behaviour of such malicious programs helps to prevent infection even in the case of a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability exploit.
More information on Automatic Exploit Prevention technology is available here.

Analysts and researchers agree that 2016 is the year when ransomware went really big.
Cybercrooks didn’t need much time to see the potential value of cryptolockers, and they readily added ransomware to their arsenals.
To give you an idea of the profitability, Cisco researchers reported in 2015 that a single Angler exploit kit brings cybercriminals profits of up to $60 million annually, or on average $5 million every month!
ZCryptor: Ransomware that spreads itself as a worm
The usual suspects of the modern ransomware market — Petya and his friend Mischa, as well as their distant relative, Locky — currently prey on users in more than 100 countries.
Hackers recently started focusing more attention on enterprises and organizations in possession of valuable data: Lately, a number of US hospitals became victims of ransomware attacks.
The rise of cryptoworms
In their attempts to get as much money as possible, as soon as possible, cybercriminals seek ways to expand their attacks so they can further propagate their lockers.
Malicious spam campaigns still work, but they are not as efficient as before; with cyberthreats getting coverage in the media, users are becoming more savvy and getting to know the most frequently used tricks.
In another important development, Web browsers and antiviruses have learned to detect and block malicious URLs or malware-laced spam.
In response, hackers have gradually phased out their usual “carpet bombing” approach to malware distribution.

Researchers predict that the next stage of ransomware development will bring cryptoworms — a poisonous hybrid of self-propagating malware and ransomware.
This new type of malware takes the best of both worlds to form a new species of ransomware that can copy and distribute itself by means of infected computers, efficiently encrypting files and demanding ransom.
The first such malware was SamSam, which sneaked onto a number of enterprise networks and infected computers on the networks as well as cloud storage containing backup copies.
ZCryptor
This week, Microsoft detected a new sample of a cryptoworm, dubbed ZCryptor.
It’s unique in that it both encrypts files and self-propagates to other computers and network devices without using malicious spam or an exploit kit.
To infect the first victim, ZCryptor uses common techniques, masquerading as an installer of a popular program (e.g., Adobe Flash) or infiltrating the system through malicious macros in a Microsoft Office file.

Once inside the system, the cryptoworm infects external drives and flash drives so it can be distributed to other computers, and then starts to encrypt files.
ZCryptor can encrypt more than 80 file formats (some sources say 120 formats) by adding a .
zcrypt extension to the name of the file.
After that, the story revolves around a well-known scenario: Users see an HTML page informing them that their files are encrypted and available for a ransom — in this case, 1.2 bitcoins (about $650).
If the users don’t pay that sum in four days, the ransom increases to 5 bitcoins (more than $2,500).
Unfortunately, experts have not been able to find way to decrypt the files and let the affected users bypass the ransom option.
That means the only reasonable option for now is to be extra cautious and avoid infection.

10 tips to protect your files from ransomware https://kas.pr/4iHH  #iteducation
Means of protection
If you want to be spared a ZCryptor attack, use these simple tips:
Update your operating system and software regularly, closing exploitable vulnerabilities and thus preventing the cryptoworm from travelling around your network.
Always be on alert and avoid suspicious websites; don’t open attachments coming from a murky source.
In general, respect the basic rules of digital hygiene.
Disable macros in Microsoft Word — they are regaining popularity among cybercrooks as a means of dropping malware.
Regularly back up your files and store one copy on an external drive that you then disconnect from your PC.
Although backed-up files do not prevent ransomware from infecting your system they are solid protection: If you have your valuable data at hand, there’s no reason to pay ransom.
Of course, use reliable protection software.

cryptor malware Ransomware self-propagating trojan worm ZCryptor
A new Android Trojan uses a victims’ devices to infect WiFi routers and funnel any users of the network to malicious sites.
The malware doesn’t target users directly – instead its goal is to facilitate further attacks by turning victims into accomplices.
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who discovered the malware and dubbed it Switcher Trojan, claim they’ve seen two versions of the malware.
Attackers have used both iterations to commandeer 1,280 wireless networks, most of them in China, according to Nikita Buchka, a mobile security expert with the firm.
One version of the malware mimics a mobile client for the Chinese search engine Baidu.
Another passes itself off as a version of an app used for locating and sharing WiFi login information.
Once a victim has downloaded one of the versions, it gets to work attacking the router.
The malware does so by carrying out a brute-force password guessing attack on the router’s admin web interface.
Once in, Switcher swaps out the addresses of the router’s DNS servers for a rogue server controlled by the attackers along with a second DNS, in case the rogue one goes down.
This makes it so queries from devices on the network are re-routed to the servers of the attacker, something that can open victims to redirection, phishing, malware and adware attacks.
“The ability of the Switcher Trojan to hijack [DNS] gives the attackers almost complete control over network activity which uses the name-resolving system, such as internet traffic,” Kaspersky Lab said Wednesday, “The approach works because wireless routers generally reconfigure the DNS settings of all devices on the network to their own – thereby forcing everyone to use the same rogue DNS.”
The creators of the Trojan were a little sloppy when it came to crafting parts of its command and control website however; they left a table complete with internal infection statistics publicly viewable.
According to Buchka, who has reviewed the site, the attackers boast to have infiltrated 1,280 WiFi networks over the last several weeks.
In a Securelist post on the malware posted Wednesday Buchka cautioned users to review their routers’ DNS settings for the following rogue servers: 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11, and 120.76.249.59.
He also took the opportunity to encourage users – although for many it goes without saying – to verify that they’ve changed their routers’ default login and passwords.
Several weeks ago a handful of router users in Germany fell victim when a variant of Mirai, the nasty malware that’s become synonymous with internet of things vulnerabilities, took hold of their devices.
While those routers didn’t suffer from a hardcoded username/password vulnerability, they did have port 7547, usually used by internet service providers to remotely manage the device, open.
The behavior of Switcher is somewhat similar to that of DNSChanger, malware that’s been repurposed as an exploit kit as of late.
A recent campaign observed by Proofpoint was targeting wireless routers and changing DNS entries in order to steal traffic.
In that instance routers made by D-Link, Netgear, Pirelli and Comtrend were vulnerable.
According to Buchka, the hardcoded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the Switcher Trojan tries to access suggests it may work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers.
Criminals are breathing new life into Cerber ransomware with a stubborn spam campaign called Blank Slate that is successfully abusing hosting providers to spread the malware.
Researchers at the SANS Internet Storm Center said the campaign has shifted from spreading Sage 2.0 and Locky ransomware, to in recent weeks attempting to infect Windows PCs with Cerber ransomware.
Sage and Satan Ransomware, Double Trouble
Identified last July, Blank Slate has effectively survived several shutdown attempts by hosting providers with a slick process for registering new servers that host the ransomware executable, said Brad Duncan, handler at the SANS Internet Storm Center and threat intelligence analyst at Unit 42 of Palo Alto Networks, in blog post.
The Blank Slate campaign gets its name from the fact its spam messages contain no text in the subject or body of the message.
Emails contain only a double-zip archive with the second zip archive containing either a malicious JavaScript file or a malicious Microsoft Word document.
The blank message and double-zip archive may seem crude, but Duncan believes crooks are under the belief it is an effective way to evade detection technologies.
The infection chain is conventional starting with the  double-zip archive.
If the JavaScript is double-clicked, or the Word macro is enabled, Cerber is downloaded from a server and ultimately infects the host.
Notable, researchers said, is that criminals behind Cerber have recently upped their ransomware demand from $500 to 1 bitcoin ($1,000).
For its part, Cerber has been a potent strain of ransomware morphing over the past year to remain a consistent threat.
Last week, researchers at Deep Instinct said the latest sample of Cerber it examined was finding great success bypassing security detection systems with a new technique where malicious code was buried inside NSIS installers.
What is most interesting about the Blank Slate campaign is how it eludes shutdown attempts by hosting providers, according to the SANS report.
“These malicious domains were quickly taken offline, but Blank Slate actors quickly registered new ones, revealing a cycle of abuse towards legitimate hosting providers,” Duncan said.
“The requirements for establishing an account at a hosting provider are easy to obtain.
The criminals only require a valid email, phone number, and credit card.
Criminals can establish new servers; those servers are reported; the hosting provider shuts them down; and the criminals establish new servers,” Duncan said in an interview with Threatpost.
Costs to perpetuate the cycle of abuse are negligible for crooks.
“A new email account can be established for free.
Burner phones are cheap, as low as $20,” Duncan wrote.
Stolen credit card credentials can be purchased on the black market for $5.
Unit 42 believes the campaign of blank messages is coming from numerous hosts around the globe from what it believes are botnets.
An examination of the JavaScript file revealed an HTTP GET request for the ransomware binary.
“Post-infection traffic was similar to several other recent examples of Cerber.
You’ll see UDP traffic from the infected host over port 6892.
That’s followed by HTTP traffic to a domain starting with p27dokhpz2n7nvgr and ending with .
top.
IP addresses for the UDP traffic changes every week or two (or longer).
Post-infection HTTP domains change more frequently,” Duncan wrote.
He said decryption instructions were dropped to the desktop in three different files.
File names began with “_READ_THIS_FILE_” and consisted of a text file, an image file and an HTML Application (HTA) file.
“Domains and IP addresses associated with the Blank Slate campaign are constantly changing,” Duncan wrote.
“With the current popularity of ransomware, we continue to see malspam daily in both targeted attacks and wide-scale distribution.”
After almost a four-year respite, the data-stealing TeamSpy malware has resurfaced, or at least that’s what a spam campaign detected over the weekend suggests, researchers say.
Researchers at the CrySyS Lab in Hungary originally identified the malware back in March 2013 when they traced it back to a years-long espionage campaign.
At the time researchers surmised the attack, which was focused on high profile industrial, research, or diplomatic targets, may have been ongoing for up to 10 years.

Fileless Malware Campaigns Tied to Same Attacker
March 16, 2017 , 2:00 pm
Researchers from Danish firm Heimdal Security said on Monday they observed a new campaign launched over the weekend spreading the malware.
The campaign relies heavily on spamming victims and tricking them into opening a rigged .
zip file that’s disguised as an e-fax file.
zip file is opened, an .
exe file that’s nested inside is activated and code – in the form of a malicious DLL (MSIMG32.dll) – is dropped onto the victim’s machine.
The malware uses DLL hijacking to write system usernames and passwords to a text file, “Log%s#%.3u.txt,” and send them along to the attacker’s command-and-control server.
The malware is interested in more than just credentials, Andra Zaharia, a security evangelist with the firm, told Threatpost Thursday.
“The malware is not only capable of stealing credentials, but can also take screenshots, gather information about the computer’s operating system, details about the security products installed on it and more,” Zaharia said.
The malware, like incidents unearthed in 2013, includes components from the legitimate application TeamViewer, a remote support tool.
While attackers previously blended TeamViewer components with malware modules, the most recent strain of attacks combines TeamViewer’s entire software.
According to Zaharia, a TeamViewer executable is among some of the files dropped into the victim’s %SystemDrive% file.
DLLs like TeamViewer_Resource_en.dll and TeamViewer_StaticRes.dll, as well as a VPN tool, and keylogger are also dropped.
Zaharia says the attack uses TeamViewer to thwart detection.
By starting a TeamViewer session attackers can access encrypted content and sidestep two-factor authentication.
All of this is done without the victim’s knowledge; the TeamViewer session makes the attackers practically invisible.
The firm says the campaign appears to be “highly related” to a series of spear phishing campaigns against Hungary.
Those attacks employed LatentBOT, a strain of malware uncovered by researchers at FireEye in 2015 that’s lingered in the wild since 2013.
The malware, while not present in the TeamSpy campaign, utilizes several layers of obfuscation, features what researchers call a unique exfiltration mechanism, and is known for being skilled at monitoring victims without being detected.
It’s unclear if this campaign is in anyway related to previously uncovered TeamSpy campaigns, but it wouldn’t be far fetched if the same group were involved.
CrySyS researchers said in 2013 there was a clear connection between samples it observed and that it was likely that one group was responsible for a series of campaigns it observed over a 10 year span targeting victims in the US, Canada, China and Brazil.
“The attackers use distinct tools for nearly every simple activity – this means that most likely the group is small and technically professional people carry out all types of activities, including strategic planning and executing the attacks,” CrySyS researchers said of the attacks at the time.
When reached on Tuesday a spokesperson for TeamViewer said the company was investigating Heimdal’s report but that it has no reason to assume a vulnerability in the software is in play.
“This is obviously a post-exploit action, so the real issue is the preceding malware infection,” TeamViewer said in a statement, adding that nonetheless users should still ensure they keep their software updated, avoid affiliate or bundles, and only download TeamViewer through official channels.
This article was updated on Friday, February 28 to include additional information from Heimdal Security.
The Dridex banking Trojan has been updated and now sports a new injection method for evading detection based on the technique known as AtomBombing.
Researchers with IBM X-Force identified the new Dridex v4 sample earlier this month and said it is already in use in active campaigns against U.K. banks.
They said it’s only a matter of time before cybercrime gangs begin targeting U.S. financial institutions.
Latest Tax Scams Include Phishing Lures, Malware
January 27, 2017 , 1:56 pm
“Over the long reign of Dridex v3, we have seen some significant changes implemented into the malware’s operations, such as modified anti-research techniques, redirection attacks and fraudulent M.O. changes.
It is not surprising to see a new major version released from this gang’s developers,” according to an X-Force report on Dridex v4 released Tuesday.
As with previous campaigns, Dridex exhibits typical behavior of monitoring a victim’s traffic to bank sites and stealing login and account information.
The biggest change is tied to Dridex v4’s code injection method.
Code injection, researchers point out, is one of the most closely monitored processes by antivirus and other security solutions.
Current injection techniques by previous versions of Dridex have become too common and easy to spot, they said.
That’s forced cyber gangs to leverage AtomBombing in a new version of Dridex.
AtomBombing is a different approach to code injection that doesn’t rely on easy-to-spot API calls used by previous versions of Dridex.
The AtomBombing technique, first spotted in October 2016 by enSilo researchers, allows Dridex v4 to inject code sans the aforementioned API calls.
“AtomBombing makes use of Windows’ atom tables and the native API NtQueueApcThread to copy a payload into a read-write memory space in the target process,” according to the report authors.
“It then uses NtSetContextThread to invoke a simple return-oriented programming chain that allocates read/write/execute memory, copies the payload into it and executes it.
Finally, it restores the original context of the hijacked thread.”
Atom tables are a function of the Windows operating system that allows applications to store and access temporary data and to share data between applications.
An attacker can write malicious code into an atom table and force a legitimate program to retrieve it from the table, researchers describe.
What makes Dridex v4 different from other AtomBombing attacks is that attackers only use “the technique for writing the payload, then used a different method to achieve execution permissions, and for the execution itself,” according to co-authors of the X-Force report Magal Baz and Or Safran.
Where Dridex v4 differs is at the tail end of the AtomBombing technique where “Dridex simply calls NtProtectVirtualMemory from the injecting process to change the memory where the payload is already written into the read/write/execute (memory).”
That cues up Dridex to use the Windows asynchronous procedure to call GlobalGetAtomA, which executes the payload, X-Force said.
“The last stage is the execution of the payload.
To avoid calling CreateRemoteThread, Dridex again uses APC.
Using an APC call to the payload itself would be very suspicious,” said researchers.
Alternatively, Dridex v4 uses “the same GlobalGetAtomW method to patch GlobalGetAtomA, hooking it to execute the payload.”
X-Force said this specific implementation of AtomBombing is a first of its kind in the context of banking Trojans and designed to cloak the malware’s activities.
Other enhancements to Dridex v4 include a modified naming algorithm, enhanced encryption for its configuration and an updated persistence mechanism.
“The changes to Dridex’s code injection method are among the most significant enhancements in v4,” wrote researchers.
“The adoption of a new injection technique shortly after its discovery demonstrates Dridex’s efforts to keep up with the times and the evolution of security controls.”
While campaigns have fluctuated in volume, innovation into the malware has been consistent.
In January, researchers at Flashpoint said they spotted a new variant of the Dridex Trojan with a technique that can bypass Windows User Account Control (UAC).
In 2015, an older version of Dridex started using an evasion detection technique called AutoClose that involved phishing messages that contained macros-based attacks that did not execute until the malicious document was closed.
The Necurs botnet has learned a new trick.
Instead of spewing spam delivering Locky ransomware, the notorious botnet is now capable of launching DDoS attacks.
According to BitSight’s Anubis Labs, the malware was modified in September to include a module that adds DDoS capabilities and new proxy command-and-control communication functions.
Necurs is the malware that makes up the botnet that goes by the same name and is currently active on one million Windows PCs, according to researcher Tiago Pereira, threat intel researcher with Anubis Labs.
January 19, 2017 , 2:07 pm
January 6, 2017 , 12:00 pm
“Necurs is a modular malware that can be used for many different purposes.
What’s new with the sample we found is the addition of a module that adds SOCKS/HTTP proxy and DDoS capabilities to this malware,” he said.
About six months ago, Pereira said, Anubis Labs noticed that beside the usual port 80 communications, a Necurs-infected system was communicating with a set of IPs through a different port using, what appeared to be, a different protocol.
When Anubis Labs researchers reverse engineered the sample of the Necurs malware, they noticed what appeared to be a simple SOCKS/HTTP proxy module for communications between it and the command-and-control server.
“As we looked at the commands the bot would accept from the C2, we realized that there was an additional command, that would cause the bot to start making HTTP or UDP requests to an arbitrary target in an endless loop, in a way that could only be explained as a DDoS attack,” Pereira described in a research blog posted Friday.
Researchers are careful to point out the DDoS function has not been utilized by those behind the Necurs botnet at this time.
Botnet owners use the compromised bots as proxies (HTTP, SOCKSv4 and SOCKSv5 protocols), relaying connections through them in two modes of operation (direct proxy and proxy backconnect), according to the report.
“There are also three types of messages (or commands) sent by the C2 to the bot, that can be distinguished,” Pereira said.
Breaking it down even further, the Start DDoS attack command includes two possible modes: HTTPFlood and UDPFlood.
The Necurs bot will start an HTTP flood attack against the target if the first bytes of the message payload are the string “http:/”.
If the first bytes of the message payload are not the string “http:/”, the bot will start an UDP flood attack against the target.
“Given the size of the Necurs botnets (more than one million IP/24 hours in the largest botnet), even the most basic techniques should produce a very powerful attack,” Pereira wrote.
“The HTTP attack works by starting 16 threads that perform an endless loop of HTTP requests… The UDP flood attack works by repeatedly sending a random payload with size between 128 and 1024 bytes,” according to the report.
The remote access Trojan NetWire is back and this time making the rounds pilfering payment card data.
The move is a shift for attackers behind notorious NetWire, that was once thought to be the first multi-platform RAT.
Over the last couple of years payment card breaches have been mostly synonymous with point of sale (POS) malware that scrapes memory from credit and debit cards swiped through the infected system.
A new variant of NetWire RAT scrapes card data and also boasts an integrated keylogger that can sniff data from devices like USB card readers, according to researchers at SecureWorks, who detailed on Monday the latest version of the RAT they came across back in September.
The RAT relies on victims opening an attachment in a phishing email; once opened the malware is downloaded and the infection can linger for months or years until it’s discovered, according to SecureWorks researchers.
Researchers claim they spotted the RAT collecting data during an incident response engagement, but that this particular variant wasn’t specially trained to target POS systems.
This iteration was a .
EXE file and gets to work maintaining persistence.
Researchers claim the file creates a Windows shortcut in the Startup menu, something that ensures the RAT launches every time the victim logs into the system.
Researchers note the file has nothing to do with TeamViewer; it was likely just the name the malware’s author gave it to trick victims into thinking the file was the actual remote support software.
In addition to copying itself to the startup menu, NetWire also injects code in notepad.exe to evade detection.
Ironically, the technique did more harm than good and got the malware noticed, as it’s odd for notepad to have an active network connection.
It wasn’t until researchers devised a decoder to decode the keylogger’s output files that they determined it was actually stealing sensitive information.
They found track one and track two card data, plain text credentials and data that helps the attacker know where the data was entered.
“The files also display the window title of the opened application, which reveals which application and website the sensitive information was entered,” SecureWorks’ research describes.
Researchers with the firm didn’t disclose which company’s system it discovered the RAT on, only that it was an organization that processes numerous credit cards on a daily basis.
The NetWire RAT is by no means new – it’s been around in one iteration or another since 2012.
Attackers used NetWire last year in a rash of attacks against banks and healthcare companies.
Victims of that variant would have had to have opened a malicious Word document, rigged with macros, to download the RAT from Dropbox in order to get infected.
In 2014 researchers with Palo Alto Networks discovered that a group of Nigerian scammers – operating under the guise of Silver Spaniel – were using Netwire to remotely control infected systems.
Researchers with FireEye observed a separate spam campaign that same year peddling RATs like Netwire and DarkComet, along with Trojans such as Zeus and Handsnake.
Retail chains are likely wary to hear of this week’s Netwire news.
The holiday season is perpetually marred by credit card fraud.
Three years ago the now infamous Target hack affected customers who shopped at U.S. Target stores during this pivotal span of time, between November 27 and December 15.
The same malware that hit Target’s point of sale terminals, BlackPOS, was ultimately tied to the even bigger hack of Home Depot that following summer, although that connection was disputed by some experts.
Researchers have observed an uptick in attacks using the banking malware Floki Bot against U.S., Canadian and Brazilian banks, and insurance firms.
Floki Bot, which uses code from the once notorious Zeus banking Trojan, has evolved and unlike its predecessor, is targeting point-of-sale systems via aggressive spear phishing campaigns and the RIG exploit kit.
February 6, 2017 , 2:46 pm
Flash Exploit Found in Seven Exploit Kits
December 6, 2016 , 1:58 pm
Cisco Talos and Flashpoint security researchers coordinated the release of reports on Floki Bot on Wednesday.
Both firms warn the malware is quickly gaining popularity within Dark Web criminal forums.
“Floki Bot is currently being actively bought and sold on several darknet markets,” wrote Cisco Talos in its report released Wednesday.
“It will likely continue to be seen in the wild as cybercriminals continue to attempt to leverage it to attack systems in an aim to monetize their efforts.”
This most recent version of Floki Bot, spotted in September, is based on the Zeus 2.0.8.9 source code released in 2011.
There have been several incarnations of Floki Bot since then, however this most recent version is being developed, marketed and sold by a shrewd hacker that goes by the same name as the malware.
“This actor is remarkable for a number of reasons, in particular their presence in a number of top-tier underground communities across a range of languages (Portuguese, English and Russian),” wrote Vitali Kremez, senior intelligence analyst at Flashpoint in a report also released Wednesday.
Kremez believes Flokibot’s native language is Portuguese and that the hacker is based in Brazil.
Typical infections stem from spear phishing attacks where victims are enticed to enable malicious macros in Microsoft Word documents sent as email attachments.
Once enabled, the macro retrieves the Floki Bot malware, according to Kremez.
“Once the malware is executed, it attempts to inject malicious code into ‘explorer.exe’ – the Microsoft Windows file manager,” according to Talos’ technical analysis of the inject sequence of the Floki Bot malware code.
“If it is unable to open ‘explorer.exe’, it will then inject into ‘svchost.exe’.”
The injection is a PE file (bot32).
“The sample we analyzed is hardcoded to only pass the address of the ‘bot32’ resource to the injected payload,” Cisco Talos wrote.
“At every stage, the malware uses hashing to obfuscate module and function names used in dynamic library resolution.”
According to Flashpoint researchers Floki Bot differs significantly from the Zeus that was distributed in mass spam campaigns.
Zeus also did not include PoS scraping functionality and was absent of any antivirus obfuscation techniques discovered in Floki Bot in November.
“While the malware originates from the well-known Zeus 2.0.8.9 source code, Floki Bot adds a hooking method to grab track data from memory thereby extending the malware operations beyond regular banking Trojan functionality, making it more potent and versatile,” Kremez wrote.
Other distinctions between Floki Bot and Zeus include Floki Bot availability on the Dark Web selling for $1,000.
The Zeus variant called GameOver, on the other hand, was only distributed to a close circle of criminal gangs and sold for $15,000 in its prime, Kremez said.
“GameOver Zeus, in its heyday, was used by only five exclusive gangs.”
In 2007, Zeus malware earned notoriety for compromising nearly 75,000 websites owned by the likes of ABC, Bank of America and Oracle.
In 2013, the Zeus code was used to construct Citadel malware, known for its cunning ability to steal personal, banking and financial information.
Denmark-based Heimdal Security reported in April that Zeus code had been re-purposed to create the variant Atmos malware, which went on to target banks in France.
Atmos can either scrape data from its target computer or simply hide out and collect user credentials.
Another interesting distinction between ZeuS and Floki Bot is the presence of Tor network support in the source code.
Talos says the Tor support code is non-functional and “appears to be under development and could not be activated in the samples.”
Both Cisco and Flashpoint warn that those behind Floki Bot have worked hard to lower the technical bar needed for cyber criminals to use the tool.
“The time required to attain a high level of skill and sophistication has been continuously reduced.
As criminals share information to defeat protections, we should be sharing it as well with our community to defeat threats,” Flashpoint wrote.
CERBER is a ransomware family that has seen its share of unusual features since its appearance early last year.
From its use of audio warnings, to the targeting of cloud platforms and databases, to distribution via malvertising, emailed scripting files, and exploit kits, CERBER has always been willing to keep up with the times, as it was.
One reason for its apparent popularity may be the fact that it is sold in the Russian underground, giving a wide variety of cybercriminals access to it.
However, we’ve started seeing CERBER variants (which we detect as RANSOM_CERBER.
F117AK) add a new wrinkle to their behavior: they have gone out of their way to avoid encrypting security software.
Normally, ransomware’s goal is to encrypt the data on a system and leave the applications intact.
Files in folders where applications are typically installed and where the operating system is located are usually whitelisted by ransomware and not encrypted.
The new CERBER variants go above and beyond this by checking if any security products are installed on the system.
The built-in Windows Management Interface (WMI) is “the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems”.
In effect, it is a powerful tool used for (as the name implies) sharing system management information.
This frequently includes software, including security products.
CERBER queries for the contents of three WMI classes: FirewallProduct, AntiVirusProduct, and AntiSpywareProduct.
As the name implies, these are for firewalls, antivirus, and antispyware products.
CERBER extracts the directories where these are installed and adds them to the list of whitelisted folders, which are spared from any encryption.
Code for detecting security products
It’s not clear what the immediate goal of this behavior is.
The typical directories for software installation of any kind in Windows are typically already part of the whitelist.
exe or .
dll extensions are not targeted for encryption either.
For now, it appears that the attackers only want to be triply sure that security software is not encrypted.
Aside from this security software detection, the behavior of these variants is similar to other CERBER variants, with a ransom demand of 1 BTC (approximately US$1,000), which doubles in price to 2 BTC after five days).
The infection vectors are also similar.

Last April 2015, we talked about FighterPOS, a point-of-sale (PoS) malware that was used in a one-man cybercriminal operation to steal over 22,000 unique credit card numbers and affected more than 100 PoS terminals in Brazil and other countries.
We recently came across new and seemingly improved versions of this malware.
Among other things, FighterPOS now has propagation capabilities; meaning, it could spread from one PoS malware terminal to another that is connected to the same network and thereby increasing the number of potential victims in one organization.
It is also interesting to note that based on the analysis of their code, the new FighterPOS samples have strings of code written in English, instead of Portuguese.
Data gathered from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network supports these findings: while more than 90% of connection attempts to FighterPOS command-and-control (C&C) servers are still located in Brazil, the number of affected systems in the US is at 6%.
The new version (top) uses the word “command” in its code, instead of the Portuguese “comando” in the original FighterPOS version (bottom)

SMFLK), which is capable of spreading copies of itself, and a lightweight version detected as TSPY_POSFIGHT.
While Floki Intruder resembles the original FighterPOS in that it is based on the same vnLoader botnet client, it appears that it was compiled on a separate machine, most likely by the threat actor that added the new capabilities.
Among the capabilities Floki Intruder shares with FighterPOS include disabling Windows firewall and default Windows protection and disabling the User Account Control.
It is also capable of detecting any security product through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
Both FighterPOS and Floki Intruder are also distributed through compromised websites, and their updates are downloaded from their command-and-control (C&C) servers.
Perhaps the most notable update Floki Intruder has from FighterPOS is that it is able to enumerate logical drives to drop copies of itself and an autorun.inf by using WMI.
Adding this routine, in a way, makes sense: given that it is quite common for PoS terminals to be connected in one network, a propagation routine will not only enable the attacker to infect as many terminals as possible with the least amount of effort, it will also make this threat more difficult to remove because reinfection will occur as long as at least one terminal is affected.
Autorun.inf automatically executes InstallExplorer.exe when the logical drive is accessed.
TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F
Unlike the original FighterPOS, TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F is not derived from vnLoader, thus the C&C communication is different.
Because of its smaller size, it has fewer features compared to Floki Intruder.
TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F does not accept backdoor commands, nor obtain any other information about the infected computer.
It only connects to the server to send possible credit card logs that the scraper has gathered.
F sample sets we have gathered is that they appear to be version upgrades what is essentially the same binary.
That is, it appears the cybercriminal using TSPY_POSFIGHT.
F hit the same environment with progressive modifications as if doing a stress test or trial-and-error.
For instance, one set contained Searcher.dll seen in RDASRV, an older PoS RAM scraper malware.
Newer sets contain RAM scraping functionality of NewPOSThings, dropped with the filename rservices.exe.

Defending against FighterPOS
Trend Micro protects customers from all threats related to FighterPOS and its new variants.
To protect enterprises from bots and malware with PoS RAM-scraping capabilities, it is best to employ endpoint application control or whitelisting technology, included in the Trend Micro Smart Protection Suite, to keep you in control of the applications that run on your network.
Companies can also consider Trend Micro Deep Discovery, which has specialized detection engines and custom sandboxing that can detect evasive attacker activities like the anti-sandboxing techniques mentioned in this entry.

Encrypting all HTTP traffic has long been considered a key security goal, but there have been two key obstacles to this.
First, certificates are not free and many owners are unwilling to pay; secondly the certificates themselves are not always something that could be set up by a site owner.
The Let’s Encrypt project was founded with the goal of eliminating these obstacles.
The project’s goal is to provide free certificates to all site owners; in addition, software could be set up on a web server to make the process as automated as possible.
It is backed by many major Internet companies and non-profit organizations – Akamai, Cisco, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Facebook, and Mozilla to name a few.
Let’s Encrypt only issues domain-validated certificates and not extended validation (EV) certificates, which include additional checks regarding the identity of the site owner.
Unfortunately, the potential for Let’s Encrypt being abused has always been present.
Because of this, we have kept an eye out for malicious sites that would use a Let’s Encrypt certificate.
Starting on December 21, we saw activity going to a malvertising server, with traffic coming from users in Japan.
This campaign led to sites hosting the Angler Exploit Kit, which would download a banking Trojan (BKDR_VAWTRAK.
AAAFV) onto the affected machine.
Daily hits to malvertising server
We believe that this attack is a continuation of the same malvertising campaign we first identified in September that also targeted Japanese users.
How was this attack carried out?
The malvertisers used a technique called “domain shadowing”.
Attackers who have gained the ability to create subdomains under a legitimate domain do so, but the created subdomain leads to a server under the control of the attackers.
In this particular case, the attackers created ad.
{legitimate domain}.
com under the legitimate site.
Note that we are disguising the name of this site until its webmasters are able to fix this problem appropriately
Traffic to this created subdomain was protected with HTTPS and a Let’s Encrypt certificate, as shown below:
Figure 2.
Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate
The domain hosted an ad which appeared to be related to the legitimate domain to disguise its traffic.
Parts of its redirection script have also been moved from a JavaScript file into a .
GIF file to make identifying the payload more difficult.
Anti-AV code similar to what we found in the September attack is still present.
In addition, it uses an open DoubleClick redirect – a tactic previously discussed by Kafeine of Malware don’t need Coffee.
figure03
Any technology that is meant for good can be abused by cybercriminals, and digital certificates like those of Let’s Encrypt’s is no exception.
As a certificate authority ourselves we are aware of how the SSL system of trust can be abused.
Cases like this one where an attacker is able to create subdomains under a legitimate domain name demonstrate a problem.
A certificate authority that automatically issues certificates specific to these subdomains may inadvertently help cybercriminals, all with the domain owner being unaware of the problem and unable to prevent it.
Domain-validation certificates only confirm that the relevant domain is under the control of the site recipient.
In theory, this should not validate the identity of the recipient.
However, end users less aware of the nuances of certificates may miss the differences, and as a result, these DV certificates can help the hacker gain legitimacy with the public.
While Let’s Encrypt has stated that they do not believe CAs should act as a content filter, they do check domains that it issues against the Google safe browsing API.
Ideally, CAs should be willing to cancel certificates issued to illicit parties that have been abused by various threat actors.
However, security on the infrastructure is only possible when all critical players – browsers, CAs, and anti-virus companies – play an active role in weeding out bad actors.
A key takeaway from the malvertising incident is that website owners should ensure that they secure their own website control panels, to ensure that new subdomains beyond their control are not created without their knowledge.
At the same time, users should also be aware that a “secure” site is not necessarily a safe site, and we also note that the best defense against exploit kits is still keeping software up-to-date to minimize the number of vulnerabilities that may be exploited.
We have notified Let’s Encrypt about this particular certificate being abused.
Indicators of compromise
The payload of the Angler Exploit Kit has the following SHA1 hash:

Updated on January 7, 2016, 3:20 AM PST (UTC -8): We have updated this entry to clarify our mention of Let’s Encrypt in relation to the reported malvertising incident and in response to the points raised by security researcher Ryan Hurst about CAs.
Let’s Encrypt was the CA used in this case, but other CAs may be abused by other threat actors to launch similar attacks.
We also clarified our positions regarding DV certificates, and reworded the last paragraph to emphasize the value of holistic solution and security posture in all aspects of an infrastructure.

Author: Trend Micro
Fileless infections are exactly what their namesake says: they’re infections that don’t involve malicious files being downloaded or written to the system’s disk.
While fileless infections are not necessarily new or rare, it presents a serious threat to enterprises and end users given its capability to gain privileges and persist in the system of interest to an attacker—all while staying under the radar.
For instance, fileless infections have been incorporated in a targeted bot delivery, leveraged to deliver ransomware, infect point-of-sale (PoS) systems, and perpetrate click fraud.
The key point of the fileless infection for the attacker is to be able to evaluate each compromised system and make a decision whether the infection process should continue or vanish without a trace.
The cybercriminal group Lurk was one of the first to effectively employ fileless infection techniques in large-scale attacks—techniques that arguably became staples for other malefactors.
A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware.
The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms.
No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn’t interesting to the Lurk operators.
This eponymous lurking behavior would earn them notoriety until their operations were stymied and the perpetrators arrested.
Nine more suspected members of the group were arrested by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs on February 8.
Lurk was believed to have siphoned over $45 million from financial organizations, ultimately disrupting the victims’ operations, reputation, and bottom line.
How did Lurk evolve from a clique of threat actors to a full-fledged cybercriminal group?
How did their operations shift from targeting Russian end users to banks and enterprises?
Our observations of the group were based on code artifacts we analyzed as well as network traffic and URL patterns our intrusion detection systems monitored within several organizations in the Russian Internet segment during Lurk’s five-year campaign.
The group already implemented certain mechanisms to prevent AV detection.
Requests during a time period or from a source IP address that didn’t match their preferred distribution area, for instance, would yield a redirect to a third-party site such as Google.
Lurk compromised systems by exploiting web browser vulnerabilities via drive-by download attacks.
Malicious iframe content was injected to high-profile Russian websites, which then served as watering holes to attack unsuspecting end users.
Malvertising and poisoning of content-serving application components, such as memcached cache poisoning, were also part of their traffic redirection methods.
Stealth was already a fixture in their operations.
Before additional malware was served to a victim, the victim machine was first verified and validated with a bodiless payload (executed in memory) that collected information from the compromised machine.
During this time we developed URL-based signatures and used them to detect Lurk-related network traffic.
The signature pattern ^[A-Z0-9]{4}$ was particularly effective in detecting URL patterns employed by Lurk from 2011 to 2013.
The average TTL (Time To Live – the period of time these signatures were effective) for these signatures was two to three months.
The validity time of the signatures also allowed us to identify the group’s software upgrade cycles.
Mid-2012 to mid-2014: Honing the Craft
Lurk was most prolific during this period, with its series of URL redirection campaigns in Russia becoming more extensive.
High-profile and high-volume websites were used as intermediate platforms for diverting unknowing visitors to their exploit kit, known as XXX.
Lurk also targeted programmatic advertising infrastructures to increase the scale of their operations.
In February 2012, for instance, the ad server of news agency RIA Novosti, ria[.]
ru, was found serving iframe redirects to Lurk’s systems.
The campaign delivered the actual payload only to a select range of IP addresses.
By August 2012, we were able to observe sequences of HTTP requests during and after infection, including command and control (C&C) communication from compromised machines.
When 2014 rolled in, Lurk started exhibiting some patterns similar with the Angler exploit kit.
For example, Lurk increasingly used indexm[.]
html as their landing URL pattern; this would also shortly appear in one of Angler’s payloads.
Exploit loading sequence in ria[.]
ru (February 2012)

Redirects to the Lurk landing page from adfox[.]
ru banner network
Malicious iframe content served by tks[.]
ru (August 2013)
Lurk’s transition from simple web-browser-exploiting crooks to organized cybercriminals also stood out.
Range and frequency were added to their operations.
While Lurk only exploited a certain set of browser vulnerabilities, the exploit code also often changed.
Larger payloads (in number of bytes) typically translated to more functionality being embedded in them, while a smaller change indicated a repacked payload.
True to its namesake, Lurk developed techniques to evade sandbox-based detection.
Aside from serving malicious content only once per IP address, the group limited the range of IP addresses to a subset of targets of interest.
Payload execution was done in multi-tier, chained fashion, and only components delivered at later stages had persistence mechanisms.
The initial bodiless payload was designed to be triggered by the exploit kit shellcode, which performed routine checks in the infected machine.
It would then call back to the group’s C&C server in the form of a Windows executable that, in turn, performs another analysis of the affected system and collected system information, such as installed software packages and their versions, operating system information and so on.
This information was sent back to the C&C server which made decisions on what to do next.
This exhaustive scrutiny, along with the campaign’s objective, determines whether additional modules would be dropped to the system.
Sourcing samples from this was a challenge because the payload’s behavior was mostly influenced by the environment where it was executed.
Acquiring additional modules of the group’s malware, for instance, was nearly impractical if the exploit URLs were loaded in a sandboxed environment.
Malicious content were also often distributed during lunchtime (Moscow’s timezone), and in very short intervals.
We surmise this as their way to hide from automated scraping sandbox detection.
Geographical information of each visiting IP address was actively crosschecked against their regions of interest—Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Exploits were also served with higher frequency on certain days of the week: Fridays, and days before public holidays.
Lurk’s infrastructure also exhibited new capabilities.
Among them were distinct patterns used in the HTTP requests and hosting providers.
Based on the hosting providers they used and timing of their hosting migrations, we observed the group compromising websites of software distribution companies and tampered their software installation files.
Their attacks also exploited a number of vulnerabilities that included authentication portal bypass flaws in programmatic ad servers, and those in web servers and other web components.
The mechanisms of redirections were different for each intermediate victim.
Some included ad banner networks or actual sites—while the website content-serving component was poisoned in others.

Lurk’s intermediate targets by year
2014 was a significant year in Lurk’s history.
A number of high-profile, intermediate victims were still at their fingertips, giving them footholds into the user’s systems.
In a word, they were on a roll.
Why not go global to turn in more profit?
Most of the domains Lurk used during this time were purchased from third-party resellers and paid with WebMoney checks and other anonymous forms of payment available in Russia.
The activities we observed indicated dry runs of malicious injections in banner networks outside Russia and CIS.
In April, we saw Lurk using redirects via mail[.]
ru, possibly through malicious injections to its ad server content.
From June to September, Lurk’s landing pages hinted at the group migrating their infrastructure and readying a global campaign.
By the second half of the year, Lurk’s geographical distribution drastically changed.
ru domains were manually inspected.
Lurk then launched a new URL pattern that served payloads round-the-clock, eschewing pre-filtering of IP address locations in favor of targeting global IP addresses.
While Lurk favored Java exploits that were used extensively from 2011 to 2012, Flash/swf content was introduced.
An obfuscated Flash file exploiting CVE-2013-5330 was spotted in December 2014.
It was delivered only if the victim’s source IP address (and time) met Lurk’s parameters—otherwise users received a 404 error response.
As mentioned earlier, the XXX Exploit Kit used by Lurk demonstrated several URL-serving patterns and fileless infection capabilities that would later be seen in Angler.
By early 2015, the difference in Lurk and Angler’s activities began to blur—many of their patterns, exploit techniques, and distribution volume overlapped.
Correlation via hosting IP addresses wasn’t very helpful, because Lurk and Angler were often seen hosted on the same service providers.
Lurk also employed dynamically generated domain names for their landing pages.
Lurk’s active compromise of financial institutions led to a series of enquiries that culminated in the arrest of over 50 individuals involved in its operations across Russia.
The ripple effect led other cybercriminal groups to lie low for the rest of the year.
Other exploit kits like Neutrino and Magnitude either shut down or went private.
Coincidence?
Based on the similarities of Angler and XXX’s exploit-serving URL patterns and malware delivery techniques (particularly their use of fileless infection) as well as shared infrastructure, we can construe a correlation of both their operations.
In a way, the rise and fall of Lurk also reflected the evolution of the threat landscape.
We can only predict the constant development of seemingly novel and unforeseen techniques for evading traditional security systems, which is exacerbated by how these can become commercially available to other bad guys.
Lurk’s story demonstrates the aptitude of cybercriminals for honing in on specific victims and profiting from them.
Whether spying for profit, pilfering credentials, emptying bank accounts, or misinforming an unknowing public, bad guys will progressively develop attacks that can neuter traditional defenses.
These threats pose greater challenges to security and IT administrators in terms of how their organization’s perimeter can be secured.
A multilayered approach is key, along with security-minded practices: apply the latest patches, block malware-hosting sites, implement URL categorization, employ firewalls and IDSs, and foster a culture of security in the workplace.
Defense in depth should also be considered—there are no silver bullets, no single network defense tool that can be used to deal with these threats.
This includes whitelisting and monitoring suspicious applications and processes, as well as well applying least privilege principles on the systems.
The attack surface—which can come in the form of software packages (including their extensions and plugins) that can interact with untrusted components—must also be reduced.
Unused browser plugins and any functionality that lets browsers execute third-party code should be inspected and disabled.
In Lurk’s case, the group favored exploiting vulnerabilities in Flash and Java plugins for web browsers.
To mitigate intrusions, direct internet access to the organization’s internal network should be disabled, and users should be obliged to utilize application proxies instead when accessing external network resources.
This should be especially enforced for HTTP and HTTPS protocols that cybercriminals frequently leverage for their attacks.
URLs and URL content (i.e. mime-types) should be stringently analyzed.
Likewise, all executable content should be considered with a grain of salt—especially if they’ve been downloaded from unknown sources.
Continuously monitoring the network for spikes of suspicious behavior—or those that may first appear as benign—can also help detect intrusion attempts.
For instance, a significant number of machines within the organization’s network suddenly attempting to resolve and connect to a domain name never observed before can indicate a network infection or exploit.
Network detection and endpoint security systems can also help notify system administrators and direct them to artifacts left by successful or failed exploit attempts.
End users must ultimately keep pace: regularly update the system, and take caution against random or socially engineered links from suspicious or spoofed emails and websites.

Posted in:Deep Web, Malware
Author: Trend Micro
We’ve uncovered a new breed of point-of-sale (PoS) malware currently affecting businesses across North America and Canada: MajikPOS (detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_MAJIKPOS.
Like a lot of other PoS malware, MajikPOS is designed to steal information, but its modular approach in execution makes it distinct.
We estimate that MajikPOS’s initial infection started around January 28, 2017.
While other PoS malware FastPOS (its updated version), Gorynych and ModPOS also feature multiple components with entirely different functions like keylogging, MajikPOS’s modular tack is different.
MajikPOS needs only another component from the server to conduct its RAM scraping routine.
MajikPOS is named after its command and control (C&C) panel that receives commands and sends exfiltrated data.
MajikPOS’s operators use a combination of PoS malware and remote access Trojan (RAT) to attack their targets, to daunting effects.
MajikPOS is a reflection of the increasing complexity that bad guys are predicted to employ in their malware to neuter traditional defenses.
Entry Point and Attack Chain
Feedback from our Smart Protection Network™ enabled us to determine the methods the bad guys used to illicitly gain access to the victims’ endpoints.
Among them are Virtual Network Computing (VNC) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), poorly secured by easy-to-guess username and password combinations; and RATs previously installed in the system.
After fingerprinting the targets—ascertaining if VNC and RDP services exist and are accessible—attackers will attempt to gain access using generic credentials or via brute force.
The common denominator in the MajikPOS compromises we’ve observed involving RATs is the timeline of their infection.
If the endpoint piques the malefactors’ interest, they use a combination of VNC, RDP, RAT access, command-line FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and sometimes a modified version of Ammyy Admin—a legitimate, commercially available remote administration tool—to install MajikPOS by directly downloading the files usually hosted on free file-hosting sites.
In the case of Ammyy Admin, its file manager capability is used instead.
The modified version is sometimes named VNC_Server.exe or Remote.exe.
Configuration and C&C Communication
MajikPOS contacts its C&C server to register the infected system.
Once registered, the server then sends a “configuration” with three important entries that will be used in later steps.
Figure 1: C&C server responds with configuration details after registration
The C&C panel in these servers is called “Magic Panel”, as shown below:
Figure 2: Magic Panel’s login page
RAM-scraping Routine
Conhost.exe is the component responsible for RAM scraping (looking for credit card data on the victim’s machine).
It uses information from the configuration file for this routine.
MajikPOS checks a sizeable range of cards, such as American Express, Diners Club, Discover, Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa.
After verifying the credit card’s track data, the information is sent to the C&C server via HTTP POST, Action=”bin”.
Figure 3: Snapshot of a “Magic Dump” shop selling stolen credit card data
Our foray into one of MajikPOS’s C&C servers, umbpan[.]
xyz, led us to more websites with the same registrant, one of which is another Magic Panel.
The rest of the websites are “Magic Dump” shops where stolen credit card information is sold.
The Dump shops currently contain around 23,400 stolen credit card tracks, sold from US $9 to $39 each, depending on the type of card.
They can also be bought in bulk packages of 25, 50, and 100, priced at $250, $400, and $700, respectively.
Some of these websites were advertised on carding forums as early as February 2017 by a user called “MagicDumps”, who has been updating the forums for new dumps based on location—mostly in the U.S. and Canada.
MajikPOS’s Timeline
Here is a rough timeline of events related to MajikPOS, based on our findings:
Other MajikPOS Tricks
MajikPOS was written using .
NET.
It’s an uncommon technique, but not unheard of.
GamaPOS, discovered in 2015, was the first documented PoS malware to use the .
NET framework.
MajikPOS, like many of today’s malware, uses encrypted communication to make it harder to detect on the network level.
It took advantage of open RDP ports, similar to other related threats like Operation Black Atlas.
We also spotted instances where MajikPOS’s operators utilized commonly used lateral movement hacking tools.
This can be an indication of their attempts to further access the victim’s network.
In separate incidents, we saw a command-line tool abused to deploy MajikPOS, along with other PoS malware.
MajikPOS is also notable with how it tries to hide by mimicking common file names in Microsoft Windows.
Mitigation
Properly configured chip-and-pin credit cards with end-to-end encryption (EMVs) should be unaffected by this threat.
Unfortunately, terminals that don’t support them are at risk to threats like MajikPOS.
While the U.S. has adopted EMVs—thanks to the implementation of the EMV Liability Shift last October 2015—the transition has been a challenge.
While businesses and consumers across the country are increasingly deploying and using chip-based PoS terminals, many merchants, for instance, still haven’t implemented the PIN part of the chip-and-PIN process.
Although the use of EMV Chip-and-PIN credit cards is not a silver bullet, EMVs are still a more secure alternative compared to magnetic stripe-based credit cards that are most affected by PoS malware like MajikPOS.
In fact, MasterCard and Visa reported a decline in credit card fraud since utilizing EMV-enabled cards and PoS systems.
It would also be useful to take note of a good PoS Defense Model.
To further mitigate MajikPOS, it’s recommended to properly secure remote access functionalities like remote desktops and VNC, especially when these expose the host or system to the internet.
For infosec professionals and IT/system administrators who protect their organization’s endpoints, consulting the appropriate documentation for securing Remote Desktop and VNC is a good place to start.
Endpoint application control or whitelisting can be employed to reduce attack exposure by ensuring only updates associated with whitelisted applications can be installed.
Trend Micro’s OfficeScan™ has many security features including Behavior Monitoring, which can be used to detect these names (csrss.exe and conhost.exe) by the event, “Duplicated System File”.
Trend Micro’s Deep Discovery Inspector can be used to determine attempts to perform lateral movement and possible brute-force activity.
MajikPOS’s C&C traffic is already blocked by Trend Micro™ Web Reputation Services.
Trend Micro’s advanced endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites, and Trend Micro™ Worry-Free™ Business Security provide both detection and blocking of all the relevant, malicious files and C&C traffic.
Implementing application control in PoS devices also significantly mitigates similar attacks by ensuring that only whitelisted applications are allowed to execute.

Author: Trend Micro
In early February, several financial organizations reported malware infection on their workstations, apparently coming from legitimate websites.
The attacks turned out to be part of a large-scale campaign to compromise trusted websites in order to infect the systems of targeted enterprises across various industries.
The strategy is typically known as a “watering hole” attack.
It was all sparked by a spate of recent malware attacks on Polish banks entailing a reportedly unknown malware in their own terminals and servers, along with the presence of dubious, encrypted programs/executables, and more prominently, suspicious network activity.
More malware are delivered to the affected systems which were seen connecting to unusual and far-flung locations worldwide, possibly where company data are exfiltrated to.
The malware in question: RATANKBA.
Not only was it tied to malware attacks against banks in Poland, but also in a string of similar incidents involving financial institutions in Mexico, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, and Chile.
Were there other malware involved?
Does the campaign really have ties with a Russian cybercriminal group?
Based on the odd wording choices (in Russian) we saw used as commands within the malware, we construe that it is just a decoy—a tactic to obfuscate the attackers’ trails.
Banks weren’t the only targets; among them are also enterprises in telecommunications, management consulting, information technology, insurance, aviation, and education.
Also, the campaign wasn’t just confined to North America and Europe, as we also observed a number of affected organizations in the APAC region, notably Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.
Here we provide further analysis and insights that can complement other ongoing research into this threat.
One of the possible infection flows involving RATANKBA
One of the possible infection flows involving RATANKBA
Infection Flow
The campaign, like what we saw in affected Polish banks, has many attack chains.
The tools and techniques employed are typical in targeted attacks due to elements of lateral movement and reconnaissance.
Malefactors used watering hole attacks to compromise legitimate and trusted websites frequently visited by their targets.
These websites were injected with malicious JavaScript code that fingerprints browser components and loads vulnerability exploits from their malware and exploit kit-hosting systems, some of which were also likely compromised.
The infection is multistage and involves a variety of malware, with the final payload delivered only to their targets of interest.
Different command and control (C&C) servers were used.
Some were also compromised machines that proxied connections to the attackers’ infrastructure.
In one instance we observed, one of the initial malware delivered to the victim, RATANKBA (TROJ_RATANKBA.
A), connects to a legitimate but compromised website (eye-watch[.]
in:443, a mobile application-selling site) from which a hack tool (nbt_scan.
exe) is also downloaded.
The domain also serves as one of the campaign’s platform for C&C communication.
The threat actor uses RATANKBA to survey the lay of the land as it looks into various aspects of the host machine where it has been initially downloaded—the machine that has been victim of the watering hole attack.
Information such as the running tasks, domain, shares, user information, if the host has default internet connectivity, and so forth.

It would be worthwhile to note that RATANKBA has also been seen looking at specific IP ranges of interest:

Our analysis of samples of the hack tool (HKTL_NBTSCAN.
GA and HKTL_NBTSCAN.
GB) indicate it as a command-line program that scans IP networks for NetBIOS information such as IP address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in username, and MAC address—with some of the information coming from the initial RATAKNBA installation.
The threat actor can now combine the information and brute force their way throughout the network (through NetBIOS) using a list of usernames and passwords as well as a range of IP addresses.

Upon successful connection, this hack tool will try to copy the calc.exe of the attacker’s machine to the targeted computer’s network share (C$) to test if file propagation via network share is successful and would most likely succeed if the credentials used would have administrative privileges.
It then takes note of the infected machine’s IP address, user, domain, hostname, OS and Service Pack, and the username and password combination that worked during the brute force routine.
A log of it is then dumped to the directory where the file was initially executed.
With the combination of the information from RATANKBA and success/failure results from HKTL_NBTSCAN, the threat actor is now free to deploy final payloads to interesting hosts.
A banking Trojan (TSPY_BANKER.
NTE) is among RATANKBA’s final payloads.
Some of the compromised sites used by attacker host several malware and suspicious/malicious files include:
An information-stealing backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_DESTOVER.
A similarly named Flash file (swf, detected as SWF_EXPLOYT.
YYRQ)
A Silverlight (.
xap) file containing several files: an App Manifest (AppManifest.xaml), and DLLs Shell_siver.dll (TROJ_CVE20130074.
B), and System.Xml.Linq.dll, which when repacked form a runtime remote code execution exploit for Silverlight (CVE-2016-0034, patched last January 12, 2016)
A Trojan (TROJ64_KLIPODLDR.
ZHEB-A) that drops an encrypted module (BKDR64_KLIPODENC.
ZHEB-A) containing a banking spyware (TSPY64_BANKER.
YWNQD), used as a Windows service persistence mechanism DLL.
Impact
Feedback from our Smart Protection Network™ revealed that apart from attacks in North America (mainly the U.S.), Europe, and South America, the campaign also noticeably affected enterprises in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Bahrain.
The targeted industries were consistent with other analyses: telecommunications (including internet service providers) and banking.
We also saw a miscellany of targets whose industries comprise internet-related services (such as data center operations), management consulting, information technology, pharmaceutics, insurance, even aviation and education.
In the case of Taiwan, we’ve seen the compromised website diverting its visitors to another malware-hosting site that also acts as platform for C&C communication: sap[.]
misapor[.]
ch.
We saw the affected websites of financial institutions in Uruguay and Mexico redirecting victims to the same URL.
While the URL acts similarly to how eye-watch[.]
in:443 delivers payloads, we also saw the URL leveraging and exploiting security flaws in Flash: CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019, and CVE-2016-4117.

Screenshot of the malware’s code showing commands in Russian
The campaign notably bears similarities with activities that seem to point the finger to Russian perpetrators.
Is there really a Russian connection?
Delving into the malware, we found that it indeed uses commands in Russian—transliterated from Cyrillic script to Latin alphabet, in particular.
The verbs used were in their infinitive form, however, which is awkward for a command switch.
Case in point: the use of “ustanavlivat” (“to install”) instead of the more command-like “ustanovit” (“do install”), which gives the impression that the malware operator lifted it from a dictionary or source where words are typically listed in default form.
Additionally, using verbs as commands is peculiar, especially for Russian cybercriminals or malware programmers who ironically eschew using Russian language in favor of broken English.
Majority—if not all—of Russian programmers know that “connect” is keyed in as “connect”, because there’s already an API call (Application Program Interface) under that name.
If you really have to use Russian, you’d rather use words like “vykhod” (“quit”) than “vikhodit” (“to exit”).
Another example is the use of “klyent2podklychit” we found within the sample we analyzed.
The only intelligible part of it was “2”, which can be taken as “to” given how there’s an API call name for it (client2connect).
In Russian, it’s practically gibberish, with the words wrongly ordered; it makes much more sense if “podkluchit_klienta” was used instead.
Indeed, with the awkward use of Russian language within the malware, we’re inclined to surmise it as more of a false flag, intentionally inserted in the code to flummox threat research and attribution attempts.
It’s an uncommon tactic, but one that’s already been observed in other malware and cyberattacks.
Were the attacks carried out by cybercriminal group Lazarus?
While there is ambivalence if they were indeed their handiwork, our analysis indicates that the malware codes and techniques employed resembled those used by Lazarus.
Mitigation
Security and system/IT administrators must practice due diligence in protecting their websites and web-based applications from threats that can undermine their security, and hijack them to do the bad guys’ bidding—delivering malware to their victims.
Malicious web injections, for instance, leverage exploits that enable attackers to gain footholds into the system.
An organization’s best defense is to regularly apply the latest patches, as well as routinely scan and examine traffic that goes through the enterprise’s network, which enables prompt incident response and remediation.
A multilayered approach is a must to securing the organization’s perimeter, especially for information security professionals and system/IT administrators.
Hardening the endpoints is critical, as bad guys can use these to enter the company network.
Implementing the apt restrictions/permissions policies on end user systems and employing application control can help prevent unwanted and suspicious applications and processes from being executed.
Disabling unnecessary—or unused—components in the system such as third-party plugins and extensions helps reduce the system’s attack surface.
Employing firewalls and intrusion detection systems on top of proactive network monitoring can help mitigate incursions into the organization.
This can be complemented by restricting direct internet access to the company’s internal networks while using proxies to access external resources.
End users can help by practicing and fostering security habits, such as prudence against dubious and socially engineered links, emails, and websites.

You can now check the results of our ongoing research into EyePyramid; this blog post dives into EyePyramid’s behavior and other interesting details from our technical analysis.
Two Italian citizens were arrested last Tuesday by Italian authorities (in cooperation with the FBI) for exfiltrating sensitive data from high-profile Italian targets.
Private and public Italian citizens, including those holding key positions in the state, were the subject of a spear-phishing campaign that reportedly served a malware, codenamed EyePyramid, as a malicious attachment.
This malware was used to successfully exfiltrate over 87 gigabytes worth of data including usernames, passwords, browsing data, and filesystem content.
Infection chain
Based on the available information and our initial analysis from the samples, it appears that the attacker behind the spear-phishing campaign managed to compromise email accounts, particularly those belonging to attorneys and associates in several law firms.
We see this as a lure used by the hacker to bait a target into opening a malicious email attachment.
Once opened, the malicious attachment, which is actually the aforementioned malware, bootstraps and concludes its loading routine by planting a copy of itself with a pseudo-random name and an .
exe extension.
Among some of the known names we found (which could change in other versions and builds of the malware):
Initial sample analysis
The malware may initially appear to be a naïve piece of code written in .
NET (>= 4.5.
x), but an in-depth look reveals otherwise.
After standard obfuscation, which can be reversed with off-the-shelf tools, the sensitive parts of the decompiled source code are obfuscated, which made detection and analysis trickier.
For instance, information about the command & control server’s URL and the MailBee’s license key (allegedly purchased under the attacker’s name), were heavily obfuscated, as the following excerpt of code shows:
Figure 2.
Obfuscated code sample
Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the de-obfuscation routine includes a decryption step, based on the 3DES cipher, along with MD5 followed by SHA256 of the input data.
The malware sends the exfiltrated data (after encrypting it) to the command & control servers over standard web transports:
Code for exfiltrating traffic
Note that part of the endpoint’s URL is not obfuscated:
Exposed part of URL (Click thumbnail above for full code)
The malware also used the MailBee.NET.dll APIs—a paid library used for building mail software—to send the exfiltrated data out to dropzones (i.e., email addresses) in use by the attacker.
It is interesting to note that the purchase of the paid library has led the authorities to the identity of the person behind the campaign.
We are currently analyzing this malware and the campaign that used this is under further monitoring.
We’ll update this entry once further verified information and details have been uncovered.

The TorrentLocker ransomware, which has been in a lull as of late, has recently come back with new variants (Detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_CRYPTLOCK.
DLFLVS and RANSOM_CRYPTLOCK.
DLFLVU).
These new variants are using a delivery mechanism that uses abused Dropbox accounts.
This new type of attack is in line with our 2017 prediction that ransomware would continue to evolve beyond the usual attack vectors.
TorrentLocker has continued to remain active beyond its peak, with its low detection rates allowing the cybercriminals behind it to work behind the scenes while continuing attacks against unwitting victims.
A familiar foe in a new disguise
The new TorrentLocker variants have similar behavior as the previous examples we’ve detected, with the primary changes being its new distribution method and the way the malware executable itself is packaged.
An example of the new TorrentLocker attack begins with an email claiming to be an invoice from a supplier of the organization where the victim works.
The “invoice” itself does not come as an email attachment, but is accessed instead via a Dropbox link that contains text referencing bills, invoices or account numbers to make it seem authentic.
Using Dropbox as a URL link allows TorrentLocker to evade gateway sensors since there is no attachment and the link is from a legitimate website.
Figure 1: Example of a TorrentLocker phishing email
Once the user clicks on the link, a JavaScript file (JS_NEMUCOD) disguised as the invoice document will be downloaded to the victim’s computer.
When the user tries to open the fake invoice, another obfuscated JavaScript file will be downloaded to memory, after which the TorrentLocker payload will be downloaded and executed in the system.
A notable feature of the new TorrentLocker variants is that they are packaged as NSIS installers to avoid detection, a technique also used by other prominent ransomware such as CERBER, LOCKY, SAGE and SPORA.
Scope of Attacks
From February 26 to March 6, 2017 our Smart Protection Network detected 54,688 spam emails which included URLs going to 815 different DropBox accounts.
The bulk of this attack occured in Europe, with Germany and Norway taking up the largest percentage.
Attacks in Norway peaked during the end of February but gradually shifted to Germany during early March.
The ransomware’s perpetrators pulled off the largest number of attacks during the weekdays with a lull during the weekends.
We discovered significant increases in infections at approximately 9 to 10 am, coinciding with the start of the work day—most likely from employees checking their daily emails for the first time.
Organizations commonly use Dropbox  to manage and transfer their files, which can result in unsuspecting employees getting tricked into believing that the URL contained in the email is legitimate.
Figure 2: Timeline showing the peak hours of the attacks
Figure 3: Distribution of attacks
We are currently working with Dropbox on this issue.
As per Dropbox’s security team, all files discovered at the time of publishing have been taken down and their respective users banned.
Mitigating TorrentLocker
Given the deceptive nature of the new TorrentLocker and other similar ransomware, organizations should take extra steps to ensure that they are protected from these kinds of social engineering attacks.
The number one priority should be educating their employees on the best practices against phishing attacks, which includes checking any email for suspicious content such as the sender’s display name or any mismatched URLs.
In fact, end users should be advised to refrain from downloading attachments or clicking embedded links in general, unless they are absolutely certain that it comes from a legitimate source.
Users should also take steps to ensure that their data is backed up by implementing the 3-2-1 backup policy, which involves saving at least three copies of data, with two copies in different storage types—preferably on an internal and removable drive—and one copy off-site.
In addition to the best practices suggested above, Trend Micro customers can use the following solutions to further mitigate ransomware threats like TorrentLocker:
Strategic planning and a proactive, multilayered approach to security goes a long way—from the gateway, endpoints, networks, and servers.
Trend Micro OfficeScan™ with XGen™ endpoint security combines machine learning and behavioral analysis with traditional approaches to identify and block ransomware.
We have tested these technologies on the malware described in this post and found them to be effective pro-active solutions.
